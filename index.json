We usually sample data iid from the target domain (e.g. newspapers), but it seems intuitive that this means we wast effort labeling samples that are obvious or easy and so not informative during training. Active Learning follows that intuition, labeling data incrementally, selecting the next example(s) to label based on what a model considers uncertain. Lots of work has shown this can be effective for that model, but if the labeled dataset is then used to train another model will it also do well?\nFor text classification this paper finds the answer is no: training model X on iid samples is as good or better than training on samples collected while active learning with model Y. They show this through experiments with four datasets and three models, training on up to 25% of the available data. For named entity recognition the story is different in my opinion - iid is consistently slightly worse, though the gains from active learning are small in all cases (0 to 0.6 point gain for the better model, 0.4 to 1.7 for the weaker model). One caveat is that these models are not state-of-the-art. For CoNLL 2003 NER, many models score around 93, but these models are getting 70-90. On OntoNotes, the best results are close to 90, but these models get 74-85. This is still an interesting result, but I\u0026rsquo;m left with a few questions:\n This work focused on a low data scenario. What if I have a lot of data? It may be that sampling iid and active learning based samples were similar here because either way the data was capturing the core phenomena. The challenge here is that you can\u0026rsquo;t run this experiment easily with an existing dataset (unless it is truly massive). How does the sampled data differ from iid data? Is there a significant shift in the distribution of class types? What about using a hybrid approach, with some data sampled iid and other data sampled randomly?  Overall, what I take away from this work is that active learning may not be the right choice for building a small dataset in NLP. For large datasets, building models, or other tasks and domains the conclusions are less clear, though it is certainly worth being aware of the risk that a dataset made with active learning may not be equally useful to all models.\nCitation  Paper\nTwitter discussion in 2018) and 2019.\n@inproceedings{lowell-etal-2019-practical, title = \u0026quot;Practical Obstacles to Deploying Active Learning\u0026quot;, author = \u0026quot;Lowell, David and Lipton, Zachary C. and Wallace, Byron C.\u0026quot;, booktitle = \u0026quot;Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP)\u0026quot;, month = \u0026quot;nov\u0026quot;, year = \u0026quot;2019\u0026quot;, address = \u0026quot;Hong Kong, China\u0026quot;, publisher = \u0026quot;Association for Computational Linguistics\u0026quot;, url = \u0026quot;https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1003\u0026quot;, doi = \u0026quot;10.18653/v1/D19-1003\u0026quot;, pages = \u0026quot;21--30\u0026quot;, abstract = \u0026quot;Active learning (AL) is a widely-used training strategy for maximizing predictive performance subject to a fixed annotation budget. In AL, one iteratively selects training examples for annotation, often those for which the current model is most uncertain (by some measure). The hope is that active sampling leads to better performance than would be achieved under independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random samples. While AL has shown promise in retrospective evaluations, these studies often ignore practical obstacles to its use. In this paper, we show that while AL may provide benefits when used with specific models and for particular domains, the benefits of current approaches do not generalize reliably across models and tasks. This is problematic because in practice, one does not have the opportunity to explore and compare alternative AL strategies. Moreover, AL couples the training dataset with the model used to guide its acquisition. We find that subsequently training a successor model with an actively-acquired dataset does not consistently outperform training on i.i.d. sampled data. Our findings raise the question of whether the downsides inherent to AL are worth the modest and inconsistent performance gains it tends to afford.\u0026quot;, }  ","date":1600373315,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600373315,"objectID":"44cd230f4f62460604c2b471bcf5320c","permalink":"http://www.jkk.name/post/2020-09-17_activelearningbrittle/","publishdate":"2020-09-17T15:08:35-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/2020-09-17_activelearningbrittle/","section":"post","summary":"Training models requires massive amounts of labeled data.

Most work focuses on either (1) commands for simple APIs, (2) generating a database query, or (3) generating general purpose code. This paper considers an interesting application: interaction with data visualisation tools.\nUsing the full flexibility of these tools is a tall order, so this work focuses on commands to modify style parameters of a figure. For that setting, the problem can be framed as task-oriented dialogue in which each style parameter (e.g. x-axis font size) is a slot that needs to be defined. Using this framing of the problem, the paper presents a new dataset of 3,200 conversations in which a person modifies the style of a plot. These were collected on Mechanical Turk by having one worker describe a target plot and another worker manipulating values for parameters to match it. There are 12 plot types with 3-13 properties, with the target plot randomly generated. Baseline approaches do fairly well, but far short of a human (either another worker or one of the authors).\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a large resource with high agreement between annotators and the paper presents detailed analysis and helpful examples. One experiment I\u0026rsquo;d be curious to see is results with a fixed number of training examples per plot type (or per slot type). Histograms and scatter plots appear particularly difficult in the breakdown of results by plot type, but they are also the types with the fewest examples (a tenth as many as the type with the most).\nI find this general topic exciting because it brings together several areas of NLP and it seems feasible to create a useful system in the near future. Hopefully there will be progress on models for this dataset and development of additional resources. In particular, there was a decision here to limit generation to slot-values, which is powerful, but does not capture the full flexibility of matplotlib (at least not without further work on representing more features this way). Arbitrary code generation would be a fantastic extension, though creating the data would require some creativity as the approach used here wouldn\u0026rsquo;t directly work.\nCitation  Paper\n@inproceedings{shao-nakashole-2020-chartdialogs, title = \u0026quot;{C}hart{D}ialogs: {P}lotting from {N}atural {L}anguage {I}nstructions\u0026quot;, author = \u0026quot;Shao, Yutong and Nakashole, Ndapa\u0026quot;, booktitle = \u0026quot;Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\u0026quot;, month = \u0026quot;jul\u0026quot;, year = \u0026quot;2020\u0026quot;, address = \u0026quot;Online\u0026quot;, publisher = \u0026quot;Association for Computational Linguistics\u0026quot;, url = \u0026quot;https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.328\u0026quot;, doi = \u0026quot;10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.328\u0026quot;, pages = \u0026quot;3559--3574\u0026quot;, abstract = \u0026quot;This paper presents the problem of conversational plotting agents that carry out plotting actions from natural language instructions.

When users modify their model or data to address the problems do they actually fix them or just overfit to the new set of tests?

In more detail, DSTC7 focuses on developing and exploring end-to-end technologies for the following three pragmatic challenges: (1) sentence selection for multiple domains, (2) generation of informational responses grounded in external knowledge, and (3) audio visual scene-aware dialog to allow conversations with users about objects and events around them. This paper summarizes the overall setup and results of DSTC7, including detailed descriptions of the different tracks, provided datasets and annotations, overview of the submitted systems and their final results. For Track 1, LSTM-based models performed best across both datasets, allowing teams to effectively handle task variants where no correct answer was present or when multiple paraphrases were included. For Track 2, RNN-based architectures augmented to incorporate facts by using two types of encoders: a dialog encoder and a fact encoder plus using attention mechanisms and a pointer-generator approach provided the best results. Finally, for Track 3, the best model used Hierarchical Attention mechanisms to combine the text and vision information obtaining a 22% better result than the baseline LSTM system for the human rating score. More than 220 participants were registered and about 40 teams participated in the final challenge. 32 scientific papers reporting the systems submitted to DSTC7, and 3 general technical papers for dialog technologies, were presented during the one-day wrap-up workshop at AAAI-19.

We introduce a new dataset that includes queries that are out-of-scope---i.e., queries that do not fall into any of the system's supported intents. This poses a new challenge because models cannot assume that every query at inference time belongs to a system-supported intent class. Our dataset also covers 150 intent classes over 10 domains, capturing the breadth that a production task-oriented agent must handle. We evaluate a range of benchmark classifiers on our dataset along with several different out-of-scope identification schemes. We find that while the classifiers perform well on in-scope intent classification, they struggle to identify out-of-scope queries. Our dataset and evaluation fill an important gap in the field, offering a way of more rigorously and realistically benchmarking text classification in task-driven dialog systems.","tags":null,"title":"An Evaluation for Intent Classification and Out-of-Scope Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jordan S.

This year NAACL and ACL ran mentoring programs to help newer members of the community and in the process of giving advice I started to question whether my own approach to conferences was effective. Most online advice is aimed at students attending for the first time. What about a more experienced researcher? I\u0026rsquo;ve fallen into certain patterns without stepping back to think about whether they are effective and what could be better.\nDuring sessions There are four main options during a session in the main conference:\n Attend a talk. Pro: Typically the most exciting work is presented in talks. Con: Most talks are poorly presented. Even in a good talk, it is easy to sit and listen but not take it in. Attend the poster session. Pro: Easy to spend more or less time on each poster. Con: Easy to start skimming titles and figures without learning much (particularly when tired). Talk to people. Pro: A great way to (1) learn about what other people are doing / thinking about right now, (2) make connections / network, (3) make specific people aware of your own work. Con: Sometimes conversations become just small talk, which is not always worthwhile (Edit: see clarification in the postscript). It can also be hard to approach new people. Relax. Pro: Being focused and engaged is tiring, a break can be rejuvenating. Con: Missing out on work being presented.  There is no perfect fixed combination of these. The strategy I want to try next time is:\n  Over breakfast, choose 2-3 talks from each session that cover must-see work for my interests. Look through posters for the topics I have an interest in and flag must-see items. If the conference provides breakfast, eat elsewhere to do this and then show up for the last 30 minutes to chat.\n  When a session starts, if I\u0026rsquo;m in an interesting conversation, keep talking. Otherwise, go to the talks selected that morning and drop by posters in between.\n  Take notes in the conference handbook on every talk I attend and every poster I do more than read the title of.\n  This minimises the number of decisions during the day and focuses on the work I am most interested in. Of the options above, taking a break isn\u0026rsquo;t included. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping this approach (and more below) will make that unnecessary in general.\nDuring breaks At the first few conferences I went to, I was constantly meeting new people because I didn\u0026rsquo;t know anyone. Now, I tend to talk to the same people at every conference. I do want to catch up with those people, but it means I\u0026rsquo;m not making the most of the diverse group the conference brings together.\nWho should I be trying to meet? As a student, I was most interested in meeting faculty working in my area. Now, I want to look for (1) the students doing work I am excited about and (2) faculty at places I intend to apply to. My reasoning on the students is that (1) they will have more to say about their work than their advisor, (2) they are the future of the field, and (3) if there is scope for collaboration then it will be easier to get their advisor on board if they are excited than vice versa.\nHow should I try to meet people? Conferences are so big these days that simply hoping to bump into someone won\u0026rsquo;t work. One solution is to contact people ahead of time and plan to meet during a specific break. The same idea can apply to lunch. Usually I have just joined lunch groups in an ad hoc way, but having a plan for the nucleus of a group and then picking up more people on the day would be more effective.\nIn the evening I always go to the conference receptions (ie. Welcome / Social) and plan to continue. The key questions in my mind are about industry hosted events and when to go to sleep.\nI usually don\u0026rsquo;t get invited to industry events these days. One thing I could do differently is be more proactive in talking to people from the companies hosting events to tell them I am interested. When I am invited, I think it is worth going as it\u0026rsquo;s another chance to meet people in a setting where it is easy to join and leave conversations (like conference breaks).\nSleep is crucial for conferences. I\u0026rsquo;ve held that opinion for a while, but on reflection I have not gone far enough. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to keep hanging out and stay up late then set an alarm to make the morning session. Almost all people need 7-8 hours of sleep, not counting the time before we fall asleep, and the specific sleep hours need to be consistent (see “Why We Sleep” by Matthew Walker). There are two options here: either plan to go back to the hotel at 10pm to be up at 7am, or plan to miss the morning session, staying out till 12am, waking up at 9am. On the topic of sleep, I\u0026rsquo;m noticing jet lag more as I get older and while the university won\u0026rsquo;t pay for lodging before the conference, I should seriously consider it anyway (but not tire myself out by doing in a million tourist activities).\nWorkshop days Previously I\u0026rsquo;ve jumped between workshops, trying to squeeze in every keynote talk from someone whose work I am interested in. In future, I plan to take go to a single workshop all day. Reflecting on the keynotes I\u0026rsquo;ve seen, most are just conference talks stitched together. I\u0026rsquo;m not learning a lot that is new. In contrast, being at a single workshop means engaging with a sub-community.\nConclusion In many ways, the plans outlined above are very similar to what I do already. I am eager to see how the changes work out and also hope that having stepped back like this I will feel less uncertain about my choices at the next conference.\nWhile putting this together I found this series of tweets from Chinmay Kulkarni interesting. Our opinions differ on certain points, so check them out: https://twitter.com/chinmay/status/988410612316286976?s=20\nPostscript: Responses After sharing this on Twitter, there was some interesting discussion. For posterity, I\u0026rsquo;m summarising that and other comments I got here:\nGeneral\n  Be willing to leave a poster, talk, or conversation. It may feel polite to stay, but time is valuable, so once something no longer seems interesting, move on to something else. This is one reason to sit on the aisle in a talk.\n  Note taking is important because there is simply too much happening to remember. One suggestion was to track who you talked to and what it was about.\n  Consider going to random things and trying to understand them. This can lead to unexpected links to your own work and may be more interesting (as everything is new).\n  I clarified my small talk point above. I definitely see it is valuable, but if every conversation is small talk then you are missing an opportunity to have a conversation you couldn\u0026rsquo;t have outside of a conference.\n  People vary in their preferences regarding staying up late or not. Some see it is valuable time to connect. Others get the same from morning activities like running groups.\n  Talks vs. Posters\n  Talks can give a lot of content in a brief period and convey the presenter\u0026rsquo;s view of the most important idea.\n  Staying for a complete talk session can expose you to work that is relevant to your interests, but you might have otherwise missed.\n  Talks are often recorded now, so you can watch them later instead (but be honest with yourself about whether you will).\n  Demos and Industry track presentations may have content not in the paper.\n  Attending a talk is a nice way to connect with someone. It means you are guaranteed to find them and there is a starting place for conversation.\n  Interactions at posters can make you feel part of the community in a way talks don\u0026rsquo;t.\n  As the community grows we may need to explore other structures. For example, at RSS, work is presented as both a four minute talk and a poster session (NAACL tried a 1-minute-madness at least once, which is a similar idea).\n  ","date":1569163775,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569163775,"objectID":"8688cfcf9442f0891ad9b6f36c8ad829","permalink":"http://www.jkk.name/post/2019-09-22_conferenceapproach/","publishdate":"2019-09-22T10:49:35-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/2019-09-22_conferenceapproach/","section":"post","summary":"Am I getting the most our of time at conferences?

All of those are two-player sequential games. In this paper (to appear at NeurIPS), we looked at Diplomacy, a seven player game with simultaneous turns.\nThe paper makes three main contributions:\n A neural model that plays the game. Software to play the game (determining the outcomes of player actions is a non-trivial problem). Experiments with supervised learning and reinforcement learning.  Our paper only considers the version of the game where players can not talk to each other (No Press). Engaging in conversation in the game is a fascinating challenge that will involve a lot more work.\nHow well does the bot play the game? It convincingly beats prior systems designed for the game. Playing against it, I saw an impressive improvement over the course of the project. Early on I won trivially with mostly conservative moves. Later I had to carefully consider my moves, and was unable to win as certain powers (e.g. Austria). Eventually I was unable to beat the bot without playing several times, using observations from one game to inform my strategy in subsequent games. I am not an expert player, but I doubt a human playing one power in the game with no prior knowledge can win against the bot. However, I think a single bot playing against six skilled humans would almost definitely lose (we did not test this setting).\nCitation  Paper\n@InProceedings{neurips19diplomacy, author = {Philip Paquette, Yuchen Lu, Steven Bocco, Max O.

What is interesting about this paper will depend on your research interests, so that\u0026rsquo;s how I\u0026rsquo;ve broken down this blog post.\nA few key points first:\n  Data and code are available on Github. The paper is also available. The general-purpose span labeling and linking annotation tool we used is also appearing at ACL. Check out DSTC 8 Track 2, which is based on this work.  You study discourse We investigated discourse structure when multiple conversations are occurring in the same stream of communication. In our case, the stream is a technical support channel for Ubuntu on Internet Relay Chat (IRC). We annotated each message with which message(s) it was a response to. As far as we are aware, this is the first large-scale corpus with this kind of discourse structure in synchronous chat. Here is an example from the data, with annotations marked by edges and colours:\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t frame the paper as being about reply-structure though. Instead, we focus on a byproduct of these annotations - conversation disentanglement. Given our graph of reply-structure, each connected component is a single conversation (as shown by each colour in the example). The key prior work on the disentanglement problem is Elsner and Charniak (2008), who released the largest annotated resource for the task, with 2,500 messages manually separated into conversations. We annotated their data with our annotation scheme and 75,000 additional messages.\nWe built a set of simple models for predicting reply-structure and did some analysis of assumptions about discourse from prior disentanglement work, but there is certainly more scope for study here. One direction would be to develop better models for this task. Another would be to study patterns in the data to understand how people are able to follow the conversation.\nYou work on dialogue There has been a lot of work recently using the Ubuntu dataset from Lowe et al., (2015), which was produced by heuristically disentangling conversations from the same IRC channel we use. Their work opened up a fantastic research opportunity by providing 930,000 conversations for training and evaluating dialogue systems. However, they were unable to evaluate the quality of their conversations because they had no annotated data.\nUsing our data, we found that only 20% of their conversations are a true prefix of a conversation (since their next utterance classification task cuts the conversation off part-way, being a true prefix is all that matters). Many conversations are missing messages, and some have extra messages from other conversations. Unsurprisingly, our trained model does better, producing conversations that are a true prefix 81% of the time. We also noticed that their heuristic was incorrectly linking messages far apart in time. This is not tested by our evaluation set, so we constructed this figure, which shows the problem is quite common:\nThe purple results are based on the output of our model over the entire Ubuntu IRC logs. That output is the basis of DSTC 8 Track 2. Once the competition finishes (October 20th, 2019) we will release all of the conversations.\nYou am interested in studying online communities This is not my area of expertise, but our data and models could enable the exploration of interesting questions. For example:\n What is the structure of the community? By looking at who asks for help and who responds we could see patterns of behaviour. How does a community evolve over time? This data spans 15 years, during which there were many Ubuntu releases, Stackoverflow was created, other Ubuntu forums were created, etc. It seems likely that those events and more would be reflected in the data.  It would be interesting to apply the model to other communities, but that would require additional in-domain data to get good results. We have no plans to collect additional data at this stage, and for other channels there are copyright questions that might be difficult to resolve (the Ubuntu channels have an open access license).\nYou mainly care about neural network architectures We experimented with a bunch of ideas that didn\u0026rsquo;t improve performance, so our final model is very simple (a feedforward network with features representing the logs and sentences represented by averaging and max-pooling GloVe embeddings). Maybe that means there is an opportunity for you to improve on our results with a fancy model? One of our motivations for making such a large new resource was to make it possible to train sophisticated models.\nAcknowledgments This project has been going since I started at Michigan as a postdoc funded by a grant from IBM.

We introduce a simple and effective technique for detecting both erroneous and unique samples in a corpus of short texts using neural sentence embeddings combined with distance-based outlier detection. We also present a novel data collection pipeline built atop our detection technique to automatically and iteratively mine unique data samples while discarding erroneous samples.

The original idea involved people doing it as volunteers (e.g. Folding@home) or as a byproduct of some other goal (e.g. reCAPTCHA), but most of the data collected in AI today is from paid workers. Recently, Hal Daumé III mentioned on Twitter that Figure Eight, a paid crowdsourcing service, had removed their free licenses for academics, and asked for alternatives. A bunch of people had suggestions which I wanted to record for my own future reference, hence this blog post.\nThese fell into a few categories:\n Crowd providers, which directly connect with workers. Crowd enhancers, which provide a layer on top of the providers that adds features (e.g. active learning, nice templates, sophisticated workflows). Annotation tools, which are designed to integrate with crowd providers (or your own internal workers). Interfaces, which make it easier to use one of the crowd providers.  I decided not to break the first two categories apart because it was sometimes unclear whether a service was using their own crowd or providing a layer over another, but I have roughly sorted them. Where possible I have included pricing, though some services did not make it easy to find. Take note of the description in each case because the data collected varies substantially. Also note that many tasks can be structured as a classification task (e.g. \u0026ldquo;Is this coreference link correct?\u0026quot;), making many of these services more flexible than the \u0026lsquo;text classification\u0026rsquo; label below may seem (though structuring your task so costs don\u0026rsquo;t explode may require some thought).\n  Mechanical Turk, a small set of templates and the option to define a web UI that does whatever you want.

Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth, text classification for 8c / label, decreasing after 50,000 annotations + a workflow fee of 1.2c / label.  iMerit, NER, classification, and sentiment tasks. When used on the Amazon Marketplace they are 5 dollars / hour (India based workers) or 25 (US based workers).  Mechanical Turk Integration Interfaces These are interfaces for Mechanical Turk that provide an easier way to set up HITs without having to mess with Amazon\u0026rsquo;s APIs yourself. Both are free, but have slightly different features:\n  LegionTools, self-hosted or not, includes key features for real-time systems.  MTurk Manager, self-hosted, includes features for custom views of responses from workers.  Annotation User Interfaces There are many annotation tools for NLP (e.g. my own, SLATE!), but these annotation tools are designed to integrate with providers above to collect annotations.\n  Prodigy, span classification (e.g. NER), multiple choice questions (which can be used to do a wide range of tasks), and relations (see examples). Cost is whatever you pay a crowd provider + 390 for a lifetime license, or 10k for a university-wide lifetime license, though they also often give free licenses to academics. One distinctive property is that you download and run it yourself, providing complete control over your data.  LightTAG, span classification and links.

The functions in this case are (1) part of speech tags, (2) word shapes, and (3) gazetteers. Importantly, as well as receiving these as inputs, the model has to predict them as outputs (in both cases using predictions, not gold values). The improvement on the test set is substantial, ~0.8 F1. Ablation indicates that POS tags and word shape are particularly important, and having both the input and output is important.

Extensive work has explored how to adapt to new domains (including one of my own), but generally these approaches only made up a fraction of the gap in performance.\nThis paper shows two interesting new approaches to this issue:\n Use ELMo, a type of word representation trained on massive amounts of text. Train a span-based parser with partial annotations.  The first is straightforward, and further demonstrates the effectiveness of ELMo. To give a sense of how much this helps, the Charniak parser goes from 92 on the WSJ to 85 on the Brown corpus, while this model goes from 94 to 90. The second idea takes advantage of a recent parsing model with a simple approach:\n Independently assign a score to every span of a sentence, indicating whether it is part of the parse. Find the maximum scoring set of spans using a dynamic program.  The structure of the scoring step allows for a convenient form of partial annotations. Simply label the tricky spans in a sentence (e.g. to indicate where a prepositional phrase attaches / does not attach). During training on partially annotated sentences, only the labeled spans are used to update the model. This gives dramatic gains across multiple datasets.\nCitation  Paper\n@InProceedings{Joshi:2018:ACL, author = {Vidur Joshi, Matthew Peters, Mark Hopkins}, title = {Extending a Parser to Distant Domains Using a Few Dozen Partially Annotated Examples}, booktitle = {ACL}, year = {2018}, url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06556}, }  ","date":1528849980,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1528849980,"objectID":"446ee8952e33797a5780b1b917212bdb","permalink":"http://www.jkk.name/post/2018-06-12_parseradaptation/","publishdate":"2018-06-12T20:33:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/2018-06-12_parseradaptation/","section":"post","summary":"Virtually all systems trained using data have trouble when applied to datasets that differ even slightly - even switching from Wall Street...","tags":["paper"],"title":"Extending a Parser to Distant Domains Using a Few Dozen Partially Annotated Examples (Vidur Joshi et al., 2018)","type":"post"},{"authors":["Yiping Kang","Yunqi Zhang","Jonathan K.

This paper asks an important question - are those metrics measuring generalisability effectively? In particular, if we sample our test set from a slightly different distribution of data, do models still work well?\nAs a controlled set up they form a simple dataset as follows for each sentence:\n Go through the sentence left to right For each word generate three words in the output, where the output words are randomly sampled from a small vocabulary that is unique to each input word  This is clearly learnable and it seems reasonable that a sequence-to-sequence neural model with attention should be able to learn it. Experiments show they do, getting close to 100% on a test set sampled the same way as the training set (input length 5-10, no symbol used twice). However, if the test set is slightly different, with sequences of length 11-15, then results vary from 0% to 98% depending on the random seed in training (other variations also lead to large variations). What this means is that sometimes the model is not learning to generalise. They also show that the models that do generalise can only do so in one way (e.g. remain effective when length varies, or remain effective when symbols are used more than once in the input).\nA few takeaways:\n Make sure your training and testing data are sampled from the distribution you are interested in More study of training data order and weight initialisation is needed (these are the two factors impacted by the random seed)  Incidentally, I am a co-author on an ACL paper that points out a similar issue for mapping text questions to SQL queries.

Recently neural networks have come to dominate in performance, with a range of clever innovations in network structure. This paper is not about new models, but rather explores the current evaluation and how well carefully tuned baseline models can do.\nThe key observations for me were:\n There are issues with the PTB dataset for character-level evaluation - it removes all punctuation, makes numbers \u0026lsquo;N\u0026rsquo;, and removes rare words (i.e. it is a character-level version of the token-level task). Given that the original Penn Treebank exists, I would have been interested to see a comparison with the PTB without any simplification. The other dataset, enwik8, makes sense as a testing ground for compression algorithms, but is a little odd for modeling language, since it is the first 100 million bytes of a Wikipedia XML dump. The paper does have another dataset, WikiText, which sounds good, but then there is no character-level evaluation! The LSTM is able to achieve ~SotA results for character-level modeling. The key seems to be careful design of the softmax that produces the final probability distribution: (1) rare words are clustered and represented by a single value in the distribution calculation, and (2) word vectors are shared between input and output. Dropout matters more than the network design, and multiple forms of dropout should be tuned jointly. This comes from analysis of a set of models trained with random variation in hyperparameters.

Systems that do this have to solve two challenges: (1) understanding the query and (2) expressing the response in a way the user will understand. Recently there have been papers in the NLP community on the first challenge, but this paper comes from the DB community and considers the second.\nThe approach assumes we have a syntactic parse of the query and an alignment between the parse and the SQL query it corresponds to (they rely on prior work for this query interpretation piece). Given that, the new idea in this paper is to take the database results and use the alignment to insert values for each field into the original parse, and from there into the original question. To avoid extremely long sentences (when there are multiple result rows) they define a procedure to identify ways to summarise results.\nHowever, I\u0026rsquo;m not convinced by the evaluation. The dataset they use was collected by (1) enumerating the 196 types of queries people could ask using the Microsoft Academic Search service, and (2) a person manually writing a question for each query. As a result, the questions feel very formulaic and also only cover cases that we already have a user-friendly interface for, making it unclear how well this will generalise to more natural data. Still, this work explores an interesting problem and it\u0026rsquo;s cool to see a direct use of syntactic parsing!\nCitation  Paper\n@Article{Deutch:2017, author = {Deutch, Daniel and Frost, Nave and Gilad, Amir}, title = {Provenance for Natural Language Queries}, journal = {Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment}, volume = {10}, number = {5}, month = {Jan}, year = {2017}, issn = {2150-8097}, pages = {577--588}, doi = {10.14778/3055540.3055550}, url = {http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol10/p577-deutch.pdf}, }  ","date":1520557908,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1520557908,"objectID":"b7d5ba73050892d60b1b59c5550fb315","permalink":"http://www.jkk.name/post/2018-03-08_sql/","publishdate":"2018-03-08T20:11:48-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/2018-03-08_sql/","section":"post","summary":"Being able to query a database in natural language could help make data accessible ...","tags":["paper","vldb","sql"],"title":"Provenance for Natural Language Queries (Deutch et al., 2017)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Usually when we learn, we have a curriculum designed to incrementally build understanding. It seems reasonable that the same idea could be useful for machine learning, and indeed there is a large body of work on the topic. This paper explores the specific question of whether a curriculum can help develop task-specific word vectors, and whether we can determine an effective curriculum automatically.\nThey define a linear model with a range of features that characterise a paragraph of text, such as the number of distinct words, the number of prepositional phrases, and the average number of syllables per word. Paragraphs are sorted by the model and used to train word vectors with word2vec. These word vectors are then used as part of a model for a target task, giving a score that indicates the quality of the curriculum. Based on this score the weights for the model are updated, using a form of Bayesian optimisation.\nOne really nice aspect of this paper is the range of tasks considered: sentiment analysis, NER, POS tagging, and parsing. Learning a curriculum does improve performance slightly, and which features are important varies across the tasks (indicating the importance of task-specific curriculums). However, the models are somewhat restricted (as shown by the low absolute performance) because they do not change the word vectors during training. For most of this paper that\u0026rsquo;s a reasonable decision, as it allows a clearer learning signal, but it would have been interesting to also see the impact on the normal training scenario and a state-of-the-art model. In my experience (and in our soon-to-appear NAACL paper) we find that variations in word vectors can disappear during training for a downstream task.\nCitation  Paper\n@InProceedings{tsvetkov-EtAl:2016:P16-1, author = {Tsvetkov, Yulia and Faruqui, Manaal and Ling, Wang and MacWhinney, Brian and Dyer, Chris}, title = {Learning the Curriculum with Bayesian Optimization for Task-Specific Word Representation Learning}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)}, month = {August}, year = {2016}, address = {Berlin, Germany}, publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics}, pages = {130--139}, url = {http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P16-1013} }  ","date":1520302198,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1520302198,"objectID":"b83da31744e9b505b578925918f6f811","permalink":"http://www.jkk.name/post/2018-03-05_curriculum/","publishdate":"2018-03-05T21:09:58-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/2018-03-05_curriculum/","section":"post","summary":"Reordering training sentences for word vectors may impact their usefulness for downstream tasks.","tags":["paper","acl","word-vectors"],"title":"Learning the Curriculum with Bayesian Optimization for Task-Specific Word Representation Learning (Tsvetkov et al., 2016)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"It would be convenient to have a way to represent sentences in a vector space, similar to the way vectors are frequently used to represent input words for a task.

To get the paraphrases they use translation (start with a sentence, translate it to another language and back, then assume the translation is a paraphrase). For negative examples they use the sentence that the model currently thinks is most similar other than the correct one (choosing this from a large enough set is key).\nThe best model is very simple - concatenate together the average of word vectors and the average of character trigram vectors. That consistently beats prior work, including convolutional models, and LSTMs. In a way, this is nice as it is a simple way to get a sentence representation!

This work is about trying to integrate a range of systems from both categories, to get something more general purpose as a result.\nThe core approach is a hybrid system that switches between different agents behind the scenes (an approach taken by a number of Alexa Prize teams). The innovation here is that crowd workers will help with the decision (both suggesting things to say and voting on which response to use), and their votes will be used to learn a model to (partially) replace the people over time.\nUnfortunately, the improvement from a learned model of votes is only small (saves only 14% of the crowd effort), and the automated responses are rarely chosen (12% of the time). That said, it seems like an interesting design with a lot of subtle decisions that require more exploration - the sets of agents (4-6 here, mostly narrow types), the voting scheme (only 1 or 2 votes needed here), choosing which agent responses to show (here, the proportion of previously accepted messages from this agent), and so on. That choice of which responses to show is particularly tricky, as with this scheme a very domain specific agent might get voted down too much initially and never be chosen when the appropriate time comes. One potentially interesting alternative would be to let the crowd workers choose which agent\u0026rsquo;s response to see, and possibly even post-edit slightly.\nNote - This post is the first of a (hopefully) regular series again.

People can have a fairly good understanding of a word given only a few instances, but it\u0026rsquo;s fairly standard to turn all words with a frequency of less than 5 into UNK when learning word vectors.\nOne simple approach is to add up word vectors from the context of the rare word and use that as the representation. This paper proposes using a tweaked version of word2vec: keep vectors for frequent words fixed, increase the learning rate, use a fixed width context window, initialise with the additive approach, and only subsample by discarding frequent words. All of those make sense, though I am curious whether it would be better to just decrease subsampling or disable it entirely.\nThe results are mixed, with the improvement over the additive approach data dependent. That might partly reflect the tasks though - something downstream like POS tagging would have been interesting, particularly since the LSTM may already be capturing contextual information that covers what the additive approach has, but not what this adds.

The neural version swaps the curated features for word vectors, and viterbi inference for an LSTM (maybe with beam search). This paper makes the argument that in reality people are very good at identifying an entity in isolation, so why do global decoding for the best tag sequence?\nGiven that perspective, they make a model that scores every span of the sentence independently using a feedforward network. To get an input representing context, they use a weighted sum of word embeddings, where the weights decay exponentially further from the span (FOFE = Fixed-size Ordinally Forgetting Encoding). The authors point out that this gives a fixed length encoding that could be reversed to recover the original sequence (assuming arbitrary precision floating point numbers). Thinking about the calculation though, a word ten positions away is having its vector scaled down by a factor of a thousand, so it probably has negligible impact on the decision. They also apply this idea to the characters of the span itself in both directions.\nOne tradeoff with the independent classification idea is that it can select overlapping spans. This is a benefit in one sense, because it naturally handles nested entities (e.g. \u0026ldquo;[Member of the Order of [Australia]]\u0026quot;), but for partially overlapping spans we have to decide which to keep. Their solution is to sort by model score and keep the higher scoring option.\nThe experiments show this is comparable with previous work using LSTMs. There were a few things I found interesting in the results:\n The FOFE encoding for characters is far worse than a CNN encoding when on their own, but give similar gains when combined with word level features. Since the FOFE essentially ignores the centre of long spans, this suggests they are both learning some representation of prefixes and suffixes. They don\u0026rsquo;t try it, but this model seems very amenable to gazetteers, which may be a way to further boost performance. They have an in-house dataset of 10,000 manually labeled documents (!), but it only gives a 3% gain on the KBP evaluation.

The contribution is a way of formulating the task as tagging, so a bi-directional LSTM can be applied.\nThe tags are like in NER (Begin, Inside, End, Single, Outside), but rather than Person, Location, etc, they label each entity with the relation it is participating in, and whether it is in role one or two for the relation. Applying a two layer bidirectional LSTM to this set up gets to state-of-the-art precision on news data. To get SotA F-score they modify the loss to place less weight on Outside tags, which raises recall at the cost of precision.\nOne catch with this approach is handling multiple relations of the same type. The solution here is to link pairs that are closest together (unclear what they do for nesting). That doesn\u0026rsquo;t handle overlapping relations, which the authors say is particularly common in the BioInfer data (I\u0026rsquo;m curious how much it is hurting here too). It\u0026rsquo;s unclear how this could be addressed without a radical redesign, since extending the tag scheme could lead to sparsity issues.\nI was not familiar with this data, so I looked back to the original paper the annotated test data came from: Hoffman et al., (2011). There is no dev set, only a 395 sentence test set, so the standard practise is to use random 10% samples of the test data for development. Also, if I understand it correctly, the data was annotated by manually confirming the output of systems, which means it will have recall errors. If interest in this data grows, going back and annotating more seems worthwhile.\nCitation  Paper\n@InProceedings{zheng-EtAl:2017:Long, author = {Zheng, Suncong and Wang, Feng and Bao, Hongyun and Hao, Yuexing and Zhou, Peng and Xu, Bo}, title = {Joint Extraction of Entities and Relations Based on a Novel Tagging Scheme}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)}, month = {July}, year = {2017}, address = {Vancouver, Canada}, publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics}, pages = {1227--1236}, url = {http://aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1113} }  ","date":1512090101,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512090101,"objectID":"1f6baf7c51dd522c844cb6886e49dd3d","permalink":"http://www.jkk.name/post/2017-11-30_taggingrelations/","publishdate":"2017-11-30T20:01:41-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/2017-11-30_taggingrelations/","section":"post","summary":"By encoding the relation type and role of each word in tags, an LSTM can be applied to relation extraction with great success.","tags":["paper","acl","relation-extraction"],"title":"Joint Extraction of Entities and Relations Based on a Novel Tagging Scheme (Zheng et al., 2017)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Most effective summarisation systems are extractive, selecting the most important sentences in a document and sticking them together. Clearly that is not how people write summaries, but creating abstractive summaries means generating fluent language. At the same time, most datasets are based on news text, where the first few sentences are a strong baseline summary (by design, as journalists need to assume that the reader could stop at any point). This paper introduces several ideas to get state-of-the-art results on summarisation using an abstractive system.\nThere are three core new ideas, one for decoding and two for the model. The idea in decoding is a beam search in which the score is increased when adding bigrams that occur in the source but are not in the output. In the model, they propose a new form of attention based on PageRank, similar to previous methods used for ranking sentences in summarisation. For every pair of sentences plus the current decoder hidden vector, a similarity score is calculated ($h_1 M h_2$), where $M$ is a matrix of parameters. This produces a matrix of similarities, which they run PageRank on with initialisation set so that all weight starts on the decoder hidden vector. That produces a score for each input sentence, which is normalised to get attention values. The second idea is that they don\u0026rsquo;t want to attend to the same sentence multiple times, so before normalising they subtract the previous score for that sentence (with it capped at 0 to avoid negative values).\nTogether, these lead to state of the art results, beating both extractive and abstractive systems. Though in human evaluation using the first three sentences as a summary remains a very strong baseline, only slightly behind this system on informativeness and ahead on coherence and fluency. Ablation shows that the decoding idea has the biggest impact, but the graph based attention does help. Interestingly, if the score in decoding is extremely biased to focus on the bigram addition aspect performance only decreases a little. That may reflect the nature of the metric, which is based on ngram overlap.\nThere are also a bunch of little details that may be crucial, like adding markers for entities (which seems like a possible space for a more elegant solution). I\u0026rsquo;m not sure the beam search scoring idea has applications beyond summarisation, but thee modified attention might!\nCitation  Paper\n@InProceedings{tan-wan-xiao:2017:Long, author = {Tan, Jiwei and Wan, Xiaojun and Xiao, Jianguo}, title = {Abstractive Document Summarization with a Graph-Based Attentional Neural Model}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)}, month = {July}, year = {2017}, address = {Vancouver, Canada}, publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics}, pages = {1171--1181}, url = {http://aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1108} }  ","date":1512000845,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512000845,"objectID":"9e94897d0270664271d733c8e96f618a","permalink":"http://www.jkk.name/post/2017-11-29_abstractivesummarisation/","publishdate":"2017-11-29T19:14:05-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/2017-11-29_abstractivesummarisation/","section":"post","summary":"Neural abstractive summarisation can be dramatically improved with a beam search that favours output that matches the source document, and further improved with attention based on PageRank, with a modification to avoid attending to the same sentence more than once.","tags":["paper","acl","summarisation"],"title":"Abstractive Document Summarization with a Graph-Based Attentional Neural Model (Tan et al., 2017)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"The first step in almost any neural network model for language is to look up a vector for each token in the input. These vectors express relations between the words, but it is difficult to know exactly what relations. This work proposes a way to modify a vector space of words to have more interpretable dimensions.\nThe core idea is actually more general, it is a new loss that encourages sparsity in an auto-encoder. In this case the model is very simple: input a word vector, apply an affine transformation and a pointwise nonlinearity, producing a hidden vector, then apply another affine transformation to get the output. The loss is a combination of how well the input and output match (reconstruction loss), plus a function that is minimised when the average activation is below a threshold (average sparsity loss), and the new idea, a loss that is minimised at either 0 or 1 for each hidden value. To get the hidden values to be bounded between 1 and 0, the nonlinearity used is a modified ReLU that stops increasing after reaching 1. After training, the hidden values become the new word vectors.\nTo evaluate interpretability they consider the top 4 words along each dimension, add a random word, and ask a person to identify the odd word out. Using either word2vec or GloVe as the initial vectors and applying this method, the results shown a dramatic difference (~25 vs. ~70). On downstream tasks the story is more mixed. With 1,000 dimensional vectors, there is usually an improvement for GloVe, but not for word2vec, and the differences are generally small. Apparently going up to 2,000 further improves interpretability scores, but \u0026lsquo;at a severe cost\u0026rsquo; for the downstream tasks. Going the other direction, to 500, hurts interpretability, and probably doesn\u0026rsquo;t improve downstream performance (it isn\u0026rsquo;t mentioned).\nI would be curious to see if taking these new word vectors and applying them to a downstream task like parsing, but letting them change during training, would be beneficial. The general idea of a sparse auto-encoder also seems cool and may have other applications.\nCitation  ArXiv Paper\n@ARTICLE{2017arXiv171108792S, author = {{Subramanian}, A. and {Pruthi}, D. and {Jhamtani}, H. and {Berg-Kirkpatrick}, T. and {Hovy}, E.}, title = {SPINE: SParse Interpretable Neural Embeddings}, journal = {ArXiv e-prints}, archivePrefix = {arXiv}, eprint = {1711.08792}, primaryClass = {cs.CL}, year = {2017}, month = {November}, url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08792}, }  ","date":1511905869,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1511905869,"objectID":"505cebbc8e9aa71e4e0f1da80d72a69b","permalink":"http://www.jkk.name/post/2017-11-28_interpretableembeddings/","publishdate":"2017-11-28T16:51:09-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/2017-11-28_interpretableembeddings/","section":"post","summary":"By introducing a new loss that encourages sparsity, an auto-encoder can be used to go from existing word vectors to new ones that are sparser and more interpretable, though the impact on downstream tasks is mixed.","tags":["paper","arxiv","word-vectors"],"title":"SPINE: SParse Interpretable Neural Embeddings (Subramanian et al., 2017)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"When people read a sentence they form an entire world around it, making inferences about unwritten properties based on their prior knowledge. If we want NLP systems to do the same, we need data to train and test this common sense aspect of language understanding.\nThis paper is about a new dataset of automatically generated sentence pairs with human ratings. The ratings indicate that given the first sentence, the second sentence is either very likely, likely, plausible, technically possible, or impossible. These ratings are crowdsourced, using the median of three ratings per example. The pay rates are fairly low, at $3.45 / hour (1.99c / example and 20.71 seconds / example), though it\u0026rsquo;s possible that the time is being skewed by outliers, and it\u0026rsquo;s unclear exactly how pay was determined (does this include Amazon\u0026rsquo;s cut? Why is it an average cost per example, rather than just the cost?).\nThe main contribution is the novel way of generating the sentences. For each prompt sentence, an argument is chosen, and then a hypothesis is generated in one of three ways (all trained with Gigaword). (1) A sequence-to-sequence model takes the full sentence as input and generates a sentence. (2) The same as (1), but with only the argument provided. (3) A sentence is sampled from templates generated by abstraction of sentences in the training data. Together these produce a diverse set of examples that get a range of ratings, with only \u0026lsquo;likely\u0026rsquo; being somewhat rarer. They also labeled some pairs from SNLI and COPA, to enable analysis of how this task compares.\nThey also provide a set of baselines for the new task. Using the baselines, they show that the generated sentences are somewhat more difficult than the pairs from existing datasets. The standard metrics proposed are MSE and Spearman\u0026rsquo;s Rho (both necessary because otherwise always guessing the middle would get an MSE better than any of the proposed baselines). Interestingly, regression does quite a bit better than a set of one-vs-all SVMs on MSE, and also slightly better on rho (I\u0026rsquo;m surprised because while there is an ordinal scale, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel like it should have a strong continuous interpretation).\nCitation  Paper\n@article{TACL1082, author = {Zhang, Sheng and Rudinger, Rachel and Duh, Kevin and Van Durme, Benjamin }, title = {Ordinal Common-sense Inference}, journal = {Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics}, volume = {5}, year = {2017}, keywords = {}, issn = {2307-387X}, url = {https://www.transacl.org/ojs/index.php/tacl/article/view/1082}, pages = {379--395} }  ","date":1511799705,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1511799705,"objectID":"8606e2e2893fd4349ff0332d4f6be23b","permalink":"http://www.jkk.name/post/2017-11-27_commonsense/","publishdate":"2017-11-27T11:21:45-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/2017-11-27_commonsense/","section":"post","summary":"A new task and dataset of 39k examples for common sense reasoning, with a sentence generated for each prompt and a manual label indicating their relation, from very likely to impossible.","tags":["paper","tacl"],"title":"Ordinal Common-sense Inference (Zhang et al., 2017)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"This work presents a system that parses sentences and identifies grammatical errors simultaneously. It\u0026rsquo;s an intuitive combination - a syntactic model should assign higher probability to a parse for a fixed version of a sentence than the one with a mistake.\nThey build on an incremental \u0026lsquo;easy-first\u0026rsquo; dependency parsing approach. Easy-First parsing starts with the set of words in the sentence and allows an edge to be created between any adjacent pair of words. Once an edge is created, the child is hidden beneath its parent, so now the parent is effectively adjacent to a word slightly further away. Then the process repeats, until there is only one word left (the root of the sentence). In a way it is like following a dynamic program, but with only a single state that ties together multiple cells.\nThe change in this paper is the addition of actions that insert a word, delete a word, or alter a word. To make it work, there are constraints to avoid cycles of repeated actions (e.g. insert-delete-insert-delete\u0026hellip;), and on the sets of allowed word substitutions. To produce additional training data, a tool is used to inject errors into grammatical text. On error detection, this approach does lead to improvements, though it changes a relatively small number of the sentences. On dependency parsing it is (unsurprisingly) worse than a baseline system on grammatical text. It does perform better on ungrammatical text, though the data is generated using the same process as the training data, creating a bias in the system\u0026rsquo;s favour.\nCitation  Paper\n@InProceedings{sakaguchi-post-vandurme:2017:Short, author = {Sakaguchi, Keisuke and Post, Matt and Van Durme, Benjamin}, title = {Error-repair Dependency Parsing for Ungrammatical Texts}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers)}, month = {July}, year = {2017}, address = {Vancouver, Canada}, publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics}, pages = {189--195}, url = {http://aclweb.org/anthology/P17-2030} }  ","date":1511383733,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1511383733,"objectID":"8fd8a3d517f2e9150e9a874bfd71b183","permalink":"http://www.jkk.name/post/2017-11-22_errorrepairparsing/","publishdate":"2017-11-22T15:48:53-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/2017-11-22_errorrepairparsing/","section":"post","summary":"Grammatical error correction can be improved by jointly parsing the sentence being corrected.","tags":["paper","acl","error-correction"],"title":"Error-repair Dependency Parsing for Ungrammatical Texts (Sakaguchi et al., 2017)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Attention, a weighted average over vectors with weights determined based on context (usually decoder state), has proven effective in many NLP tasks.

Should that matrix be shared for the two steps, or different? (the first informs the decision of what to give high weight in the average, the second determines what is being averaged over) sentinel gates, a modification to the way the inputs and context vector are combined that allow one or the other to be ignored.  They consider two tasks, (1) translation when both an image and source sentence are given, (2) post-editing a translated sentence with the original source given. The results show fairly clear trends, though the systems are not great compared to baselines (worse than a text only baseline for the first, and only slightly better than a direct MT system for the second). The trends are that hierarchical is best, the sentinel doesn\u0026rsquo;t help, and it is better to not share weights (though I wonder if that would be true when controlling for the total number of parameters).\nCitation  Paper\n@InProceedings{libovicky-helcl:2017:Short, author = {Libovick\\'{y}, Jind\\v{r}ich and Helcl, Jind\\v{r}ich}, title = {Attention Strategies for Multi-Source Sequence-to-Sequence Learning}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers)}, month = {July}, year = {2017}, address = {Vancouver, Canada}, publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics}, pages = {196--202}, url = {http://aclweb.org/anthology/P17-2031} }  ","date":1511300539,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1511300539,"objectID":"7103ce382f622565f31a7cba82c48962","permalink":"http://www.jkk.name/post/2017-11-21_multiinputattention/","publishdate":"2017-11-21T16:42:19-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/2017-11-21_multiinputattention/","section":"post","summary":"To apply attention across multiple input sources, it is best to apply attention independently and then have a second phase of attention over the summary vectors for each source.","tags":["paper","acl","neural-network"],"title":"Attention Strategies for Multi-Source Sequence-to-Sequence Learning (Libovicky et al., 2017)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Like the UCCA parser, this paper explores a transition-based neural model for semantic parsing, but for Minimal Recursion Semantics instead of Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation.

Here, crossing edges can be added with a transition that forms edges between the front of the buffer and a word anywhere in the stack, while the UCCA parser used swapping and a additional reduce actions for graph edges. The models are similar, both using a form of stack-RNN, but with different structures (partly as a result of the different transition schemes). The results in this case are not state-of-the-art, though this task has received more attention, and the data is slightly biased (the parser that does better, ACE, is based on the grammar that was used to determine which sentences to include).

Or both?).\nCitation  Paper\n@article{TACL1065, author = {Yamada, Ikuya and Shindo, Hiroyuki and Takeda, Hideaki and Takefuji, Yoshiyasu }, title = {Learning Distributed Representations of Texts and Entities from Knowledge Base}, journal = {Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics}, volume = {5}, year = {2017}, issn = {2307-387X}, url = {https://www.transacl.org/ojs/index.php/tacl/article/view/1065}, pages = {397--411} }  ","date":1510786887,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1510786887,"objectID":"f6885ee882016f8af93335a228b74cd0","permalink":"http://www.jkk.name/post/2017-11-15_entityvectors/","publishdate":"2017-11-15T18:01:27-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/2017-11-15_entityvectors/","section":"post","summary":"Vectors for words and entities can be learned by trying to model the text written about the entities.

The difference is whether a non-terminal is placed on the stack before or after the words that it spans. This corresponds to two forms of depth-first traversal of the tree: pre-order or post-order.\nThe idea in this paper is to do an in-order traversal, which in a binary tree means traversing the left child of a node, then the node, then its right child. In this context that means putting the non-terminal symbol on the stack after the first word it spans, but before the rest. The model follows the stack-LSTM approach of Dyer et al., with non-terminals always fed into the LSTM first during composition, regardless of where it was inserted into the stack.\nThis leads to a 0.5 F1 gain on standard parsing metrics, with no hyperparameter tuning. High-level error analysis seems to show it just does better everywhere.

Their small scale and clear success criteria make them a convenient testbed for dialogue agents, going back decades, with recent work focusing on neural approaches. This paper considers a simple game and constrains models in various ways to improve performance and see how their communication varies, a line of work also appearing in recent papers by Jacob Andreas ( ACL 2017, EMNLP 2017).\nThe game in this case is to find out two properties of an object, where there are three possible properties, each with four possible values. Given enough flexibility, models will explicitly encode every possible structure of the world as a separate symbol, which does not generalise well. Limiting the vocabulary to one symbol per property and one per value helps, but in this particular game there are only 3 possible questions, and over two turns of dialogue the 12 value words are sufficient to encode the space. Limiting even further, to 4 words for values and providing each turn in isolation to the answerer does lead to some compositionality, but clearly not full compositionality as they still make errors on unseen combinations of the inputs.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a short paper, so they can only do so much, but some experiments I am curious about are:\n Decrease the questioner vocabulary to 2. This avoids the problem that the questioner can express the task in one step by saying what is not needed. It\u0026rsquo;s still doable, by defining an order for questions, e.g. ask about attribute A vs. B first, then in the second step ask about either C or the other option from the first step. This is a little weird as symbols need to mean different things at different time steps, but would be interesting. Increase the number of attributes to 4. This also avoids the task expression problem, by forcing there to be compositionality on the questioner side (watching the video of the talk, someone asked this in the question time, and they didn\u0026rsquo;t know).

This paper looks at how to integrate vector representations of structured information into an LSTM. The solution is an additional processing step during output generation, in which the vectors for relevant entities in the structured data are combined with the standard LSTM output (note, they do not affect the cell itself, so the information is not passed on through the recurrence).\nIn this case the structured information is a set of tuples forming a graph of relations between entities, from either NELL or WordNet. The actual encoding of entities is an application of prior work; vectors representing tuples are trained with the objective that the score for any tuple is higher than made-up tuples (where the score is $v_a M_r v_b$ for entities $a$ and $b$ in relation $r$). The set of relevant entities for a particular word in the sentence is obtained by string matching, and then attention is used to combine them. There is also a kind of gating mechanism to choose how big a role the entities play in the prediction, using a combination of the input, hidden state, and cell state.\nThe results are interesting not only because this method helps, but because of how well the standard LSTM does on this task, matching or exceeding prior results. This is even more impressive given how small ACE is (if I remember correctly). The other key observations are that having a sequence level loss (using a CRF) helps, and NELL and WordNet seem to be providing different types of information (as using both leads to further improvements).\nCitation  Paper\n@InProceedings{yang-mitchell:2017:Long, author = {Yang, Bishan and Mitchell, Tom}, title = {Leveraging Knowledge Bases in LSTMs for Improving Machine Reading}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)}, month = {July}, year = {2017}, address = {Vancouver, Canada}, publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics}, pages = {1436--1446}, url = {http://aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1132} }  ","date":1510346235,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1510346235,"objectID":"e86a4765e6d7213554b4bd65c69f0150","permalink":"http://www.jkk.name/post/2017-11-10_kginlstm/","publishdate":"2017-11-10T15:37:15-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/2017-11-10_kginlstm/","section":"post","summary":"Incorporating vector representations of entities from structured resources like NELL and WordNet into the output of an LSTM can improve entity and event extraction.","tags":["paper","acl","knowledge-graph"],"title":"Leveraging Knowledge Bases in LSTMs for Improving Machine Reading (Yang et al., 2017)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Another paper about a dataset of dialogues, but this time with structure. Like the paper from yesterday, the aim is a dataset of task-oriented conversations, but with more complexity than prior work. The difference is that this work includes a structured representation of the state of the conversation: frames.\nA frame is essentially a tuple describing a query, e.g. (Destination: Sydney, Origin: Ann Arbor, price: 1500 USD). There are multiple frames in a dialogue (a departure from DSTC tasks), and utterances are labeled with dialogue acts that capture modifications to the frames as well as references to them. This structure sounds fairly general, though the focus here was on vacation planning, where the user is buying a package. The setup doesn\u0026rsquo;t maximise the potential complexity though, as there are a small number of set packages available, rather than the complex tradeoffs of flight+hotel combinations that exist in practise. Looking at the example dialogues in the paper, it has complete sentences of some complexity. One thing I\u0026rsquo;m still curious about is disagreements between annotators, as for the complete task the score was 0.62 +/- 5 (with dialogue acts being trickier than slot values, and no scores for frame references on their own).\nComparing to the Stanford dataset this is smaller (11k vs. 1.4k), but has more turns per dialogue (11 vs. 15) and probably longer turns too, judging by the examples. The tasks are completely different, but both come with small tables of information that are private to the two participants and required for almost every turn in the conversation. Evaluating on both could be a great way to show the flexibility of a dialogue system, but the lack of frames for the Stanford data and the difficulty of running a human evaluation for this data limits the feasible types of multi-domain experiments.\nCitation  Paper\n@InProceedings{elasri-EtAl:2017:W17-55, author = {El Asri, Layla and Schulz, Hannes and Sharma, Shikhar and Zumer, Jeremie and Harris, Justin and Fine, Emery and Mehrotra, Rahul and Suleman, Kaheer}, title = {Frames: a corpus for adding memory to goal-oriented dialogue systems}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 18th Annual SIGdial Meeting on Discourse and Dialogue}, month = {August}, year = {2017}, address = {Saarbrucken, Germany}, publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics}, pages = {207--219}, url = {http://aclweb.org/anthology/W17-5526} }  ","date":1510274828,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1510274828,"objectID":"7a2975309d9bac8111296d0dc018e370","permalink":"http://www.jkk.name/post/2017-11-09_framesdataset/","publishdate":"2017-11-09T19:47:08-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/2017-11-09_framesdataset/","section":"post","summary":"A new dialogue dataset that has annotations of multiple plans (frames) and dialogue acts that indicate modifications to them.","tags":["paper","sigdial","dialogue","data"],"title":"Frames: a corpus for adding memory to goal-oriented dialogue systems (El Asri et al., 2017)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Task-oriented dialogue systems are often focused on a very narrow task, to the point where the state can be described completely with a tuple (e.g. preferences for a restaurant).

They collected 11,000 dialogues, where two people have private lists of friends and are trying to identify which friend they have in common. While this is a lot of data, the mechanical turk workers are clearly moving fast, with dialogues taking 1.5 minutes on average, and in 18% of cases they get the friend wrong.\nThe algorithmic contribution is that the lists of people are represented as a graph, where nodes are properties like company and hobby. The graph is used to generate vectors for each person by running a form of message passing over its structure. During generation, the LSTM uses attention over these vectors to inform the output choice.\nA few interesting things in the output:\n There are cases where the output is incorrect, as in, says a fact about the structured information / knowledge base that is false.

Conveniently, this is orthogonal to many other ideas and can essentially be stapled on top of a range of sequential architectures, consistently leading to improvements.\nOne question left open is how this would work in generation. The paper describes how it could be applied and could provide improvements, but it also seems likely to risk the repetitive outputs seen in many dialogue systems.\nCitation  ArXiv Paper\n@ARTICLE{2017arXiv170907432K, author = {{Krause}, B. and {Kahembwe}, E. and {Murray}, I. and {Renals}, S.}, title = \u0026quot;{Dynamic Evaluation of Neural Sequence Models}\u0026quot;, journal = {ArXiv e-prints}, archivePrefix = \u0026quot;arXiv\u0026quot;, eprint = {1709.07432}, keywords = {Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing, Computer Science - Computation and Language}, year = 2017, month = sep, adsurl = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv170907432K}, adsnote = {Provided by the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System}, }  ","date":1509384510,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509384510,"objectID":"3df0d80316023bb32524b6f902c5dc29","permalink":"http://www.jkk.name/post/2017-10-30_neuralsequence/","publishdate":"2017-10-30T13:28:30-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/2017-10-30_neuralsequence/","section":"post","summary":"Language model perplexity can be reduced by maintaining a separate model that is updated during application of the model, allowing adaptation to short-term patterns in the text.","tags":["paper","arxiv","neural-network","language-model"],"title":"Dynamic Evaluation of Neural Sequence Models (Krause et al., 2017)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Update After prior work came to light that uses the same non-linearity, this paper was updated to focus more on the search process used to investigate the space. One new takeaway for me was how diverse the effective activation functions were (see figures in the new version of the paper).\nOriginal Post Non-linear functions are the key to the representation power of neural networks. Many different ones have been proposed, though it is difficult to make theoretical claims of their properties and so the choice of which to use is generally empirical. This paper proposes a new non-linearity, $\\text{swish}(x) = x \\cdot \\text{sigmoid}(x)$.\nInterestingly, it was chosen by a combination of exhaustive search and search with reinforcement learning across a range of functions, evaluating on CIFAR-10 with a small model. ReLU variants were consistently second-best to swish variants, and generally the more complicated functions performed worse. They do mention two functions that performed well, but didn\u0026rsquo;t generalise: $\\text{cos}(x) - x$ and $\\text{max}(x, \\text{tanh}(x))$, which look like this:\nIn a range of experiments in vision and machine translation swish does at least as well or slightly better than the alternatives. It also seems more robust to network depth and to work across different network structures. As for why it works so well, there are two main ideas: (1) it adds smoothness to the ReLU, (2) it has some sensitivity to negative inputs. Both of these seem particularly important at the start of training.\nCitation  ArXiv Paper\n@ARTICLE{2017arXiv171005941R, author = {{Ramachandran}, P. and {Zoph}, B. and {Le}, Q.~V.}, title = \u0026quot;{Swish: a Self-Gated Activation Function}\u0026quot;, journal = {ArXiv e-prints}, archivePrefix = \u0026quot;arXiv\u0026quot;, eprint = {1710.05941}, keywords = {Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing, Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Computer Science - Learning}, year = 2017, month = oct, adsurl = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv171005941R}, adsnote = {Provided by the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System} }  ","date":1509117765,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509117765,"objectID":"3132165cf872819f385bc96a60aa4f41","permalink":"http://www.jkk.name/post/2017-10-27_swishactivation/","publishdate":"2017-10-27T11:22:45-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/2017-10-27_swishactivation/","section":"post","summary":"Switching from the ReLU non-linearity, $\\text{max}(0, x)$, to Swish, $x \\cdot \\text{sigmoid}(x)$, consistently improves performance in neural networks across both vision and machine translation tasks.","tags":["paper","neural-network","arxiv"],"title":"Searching for Activation Functions (Ramachandran et al., 2017)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Word2Vec and other approaches provide a single vector representing a word\u0026rsquo;s meaning, giving words spatially defined relationships capturing relatedness. A natural extension is to consider regions in that space and allow some words to take up larger or smaller regions. Another natural idea is to allow a single word to have multiple representations, to capture the different senses. This paper considers both of those ideas, using multiple gaussian distributions per word.\nUsing gaussians has the nice property that there is a closed form for calculating the amount of overlap between them, which is used as a measure of similarity. Following ideas from word2vec, during learning the aim is to increase similarity between words that occur together and decrease it between random pairs that do not occur together. Once the word representations are learned, KL divergence is used for similarity, along with the standard approaches that only look at the gaussian centres.\nIn practise, two spherical distributions per word is sufficient. Performance is better than word2vec and several other approaches for multi-sense word embeddings. There was one puzzling line about the model suffering larger variance problems, but it was not quantified.\nIt would be very interesting to inject some knowledge, such as from WordNet, to guide the number of gaussians per word, rather than giving them all N. The paper also doesn\u0026rsquo;t get into details about the learned space, for example, are the two senses often far apart or close together?

One way of viewing this is that the DP gives a more intelligent type of beam, avoiding the issue where the beam is filled with minor variations on a theme. Results are given for various beam sizes in both approaches, but it would be interesting to see a graph where the x-axis is number of items built.

Interestingly, the changes have simplified the overall model, as well as enabling it to do even better than the previous model, but now without any supervised training.\nOne key change is that there is a single core neural network learning to represent the game state. On top of that there are either a set of layers that produce an evaluation of the quality of a position, or there are a set of layers that place a distribution over moves. This ties in nicely to a lot of work happening at the moment on multi-task learning in NLP and elsewhere.\nGetting into the details, they use monte-carlo tree search to choose actions during training, then update the model to better match the outcomes observed. Starting from a completely random initialisation, the argument for why this works is that at every point in self-play the MCTS informed outcomes are just slightly better than the current model. That edge is enough to provide a useful signal, without being such a drastic shift because in self-play the two sides are closely matched. Interestingly, while the unsupervised model is worse at predicting what expert human players will do in a game, it is still better at predicting which player will win.\nCitation  Paper\n@Article{AlphaGoZero, author = {Silver, David and Schrittwieser, Julian and Simonyan, Karen and Antonoglou, Ioannis and Huang, Aja and Guez, Arthur and Hubert, Thomas and Baker, Lucas and Lai, Matthew and Bolton, Adrian and Chen, Yutian and Lillicrap, Timothy and Hui, Fan and Sifre, Laurent and van den Driessche, George and Graepel, Thore and Hassabis, Demis}, title = {Mastering the game of Go without human knowledge}, journal = {Nature}, year = {2017}, volume = {550}, issue = {7676}, pages = {354-359}, publisher = {Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature}, doi = {10.1038/nature24270}, url = {http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v550/n7676/abs/nature24270.html#supplementary-information}, }  ","date":1508807577,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1508807577,"objectID":"dff037bad9edf2bcf813daf71de48c69","permalink":"http://www.jkk.name/post/2017-10-23_alphagozero/","publishdate":"2017-10-23T21:12:57-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/2017-10-23_alphagozero/","section":"post","summary":"By using a single core model to build a game state representation, which then gives input to both state evaluation and move choice, DeepMind are able to apply reinforcement learning with self-play with no supervision and achieve state-of-the-art performance.","tags":["paper","rl"],"title":"Mastering the game of Go without human knowledge (Silver et al., Nature 2017)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Recurrent neural networks like LSTMs and GRUs have limited scope for parallelisation because each step depends on the one before it. This architecture also means that many steps of computation separate two words that are far apart, making it difficult to capture long-distance relations. A range of approaches have been used to try to address these issues, such as convolutional structures and other forms of recurrence (e.g. QRNNs). The idea in this work is to use attention, applied multiple times, to get a network that is fast while still capturing positional information.\nTo explain the structure I put together the figure below, which captures the network structure with a few simplifications:\nThere a few ideas being brought together here:\n Positional encoding, which is a vector of the same length as the word representation, but that depends only on the position in the input. Here they use $f(pos, dim) = sin(pos / 10000^{2 dim / d_w})$ for even dimensions and the cosine equivalent for odd dimensions (where $d_w$ is the number of dimensions. Multi-head attention, where rather than running attention once on the full vector, multiple linear transforms are applied to get smaller vectors. Scaled dot product attention, the equation is shown in the figure, the key new idea is to rescale by the square root of the dimensionality so that larger vectors don\u0026rsquo;t produce excessively sharp distributions after the softmax is applied. The more general form of this described in the paper has keys ($K$), queries ($Q$) and values ($V$), but the network uses the same vector for the key and value. I show the query with a solid line and the values/keys with dotted lines. The matrix $V$ is formed by using the $v$ vectors as rows, while $Q$ is formed by duplicating $q$ in every row. Note, on the left hand side attention is over all input words, while on the right it is only over the words produced so far (ie. content to the left). Layer normalisation, a way to rescale weights to keep vector outputs in a nice range, from Ba, Kiros and Hinton (ArXiv 2016). Other details, (1) When the outputs are words, the vectors used to initially represent each input word are also used to represent the outputs and in the final linear transformation (though with some rescaling). (2) They use a formula I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen before to adjust the learning rate during training, (3) dropout in several places and label smoothing are used for regularization.  Simplifications in the figure:\n For multi-head attention I only show two transforms, while in practise they used 8. The shaded regions are duplicated 6 times to create a stack, with the output of one region acting as the input to the next copy of it. The links from left to right are always from the top of the input stack. The musical repeat signs indicate that the structure is essentially the same. On the output side this isn\u0026rsquo;t quite true since the attention boxes only take inputs to their left (since output to the right doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist when they are being calculated).  In terms of experiments, it works at least as well if not better than prior approaches, and is a lot faster for machine translation (no speed numbers are given for parsing). There is also some nice analysis of what it ends out using the attention mechanism to focus on for each word. It seems like it can provide a way to effectively disambiguate the sense of a word based on its context.\nCitation  ArXiv Paper\nGoogle also has some blog posts up about the paper and about the library they released.\n@article{arxiv:1706.03762, author = {Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N.

Getting multiple annotations costs more, and the quality of annotators can vary considerably (with spamming at one extreme). One way to avoid the quality issue is to restrict who can do the task (must have done X previous tasks with an accept rate of Y), but that limits the pool of available workers. Another approach is to try to estimate the quality of annotator work using a statistical model.\nHere a generative model is used, with the following structure:\n $T_i$, the true label, sampled with a uniform prior over labels $S_{ij}$, a binary variable indicating if the person is spamming or not, sampled as a Bernoulli variable with a Beta prior $A_{ij}$, the annotator\u0026rsquo;s decision, if they are spamming it is sampled from a multinomial with parameters specific to them (with a Dirichlet prior), otherwise it is the true label  $A$ is observed, but $T$ and $S$ are not, so they use expectation maximization to get both model parameters and variable values. To deal with nonconvexity they use 100 random restarts, deciding which is best based on how well the model describes the data. Note - this model (and the code) was the basis of the error detection paper I wrote about recently.\nFor predicting annotator quality the model is consistently effective across three datasets, though the Beta and Dirichlet priors are key for one (where annotator agreement was high on average). For determining the correct answer it is slightly better than majority vote, though the gains are small. The real advantage comes in deciding whether to discard data, where the choice of what to discard can be guided by the estimate of quality (this is what the error detection paper was doing). A range of synthetic experiments also show positive results, though their design shares the assumptions about behaviour that are baked into the model.\nI found a few results particularly interesting:\n As the number of annotators is decreased, the benefit of this approach over majority vote grows to be quite substantial (the main experiments are for data with 10 annotators). If you do use majority vote, use an odd number of annotators. Switching to an even number mainly seems to create ties. The right number is also very data dependent.

The system they develop is based on the encoder-decoder with attention approach, which has previously done poorly for AMR, partially because of sparsity.\nTheir solution is to merge certain types of symbols into groups (dates, named entities, rare verbs, constants, etc) and have a standard way to map from the surface form to the output symbol. This is an alternative to the approach from the paper I wrote about last week. They also introduce a completely separate idea, which is a different way to take an AMR graph and turn it into a linear sequence. This change is necessary to make the output follow the form their model generates - a sequence (though there has been work on tree based LSTMs on the output side, so AMR could be directly generated, and I believe there has been some work on applying that to AMR).\nTogether these changes do substantially improve performance over previous encoder-decoder based work for AMR. However, there is still a substantial gap between the system and state-of-the-art, presumably because of the additional resources that other systems indirectly use by running external systems for NER, dependency parsing, etc. Given the recent success of multi-task learning with neural nets, it would be interesting to see if those resources could be used here to further boost performance.

Here we see an example of how it can be applied in the case of modeling a threaded discussion.\nAttention is applied in two ways. First, over a fixed set of vectors. This is intended to provide a mechanism to choose between several different sub-models contained within a single model. Put differently, the vectors provide a set of latent representations that capture each of the different types of posts in the subreddit. Second, attention over the current utterance is used in the process of predicting responses (at training time only). This provides an additional source of input to the model, by forcing it to explain the response utterances using the same representations as a source of information.\nThe application is a new task, using values assigned to posts = upvotes - downvotes (i.e. Reddit karma). Predicting the specific value is hard, so the task is split into 7 binary decisions about whether a post has a score higher or lower than some value. On this task the new approach provides consistent gains, though overall performance remains low (53 - 56%). Confusingly though, one of the figures (number 4) seems to suggest that it was a single multi-way decision, not a set of binary decisions. I\u0026rsquo;m also curious about the data, in particular what the distribution of scores is. The paper mentions it is Zipfian, but surely it would be something double-sided with a massive peak at 0 and a rapid drop in either direction?\nOverall, this is further evidence of the versatility of the idea of attention!\nCitation  Paper\n@InProceedings{cheng-fang-ostendorf:2017:EMNLP2017, author = {Cheng, Hao and Fang, Hao and Ostendorf, Mari}, title = {A Factored Neural Network Model for Characterizing Online Discussions in Vector Space}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing}, month = {September}, year = {2017}, address = {Copenhagen, Denmark}, publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics}, pages = {2286--2296}, url = {https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D17-1242} }  ","date":1508201707,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1508201707,"objectID":"ecef32f2b0cff5f80e009fc3ae5a4cb1","permalink":"http://www.jkk.name/post/2017-10-16_forumrnn/","publishdate":"2017-10-16T20:55:07-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/2017-10-16_forumrnn/","section":"post","summary":"A proposal for how to improve vector representations of sentences by using attention over (1) fixed vectors, and (2) a context sentence.","tags":["paper","emnlp","word-vectors"],"title":"A Factored Neural Network Model for Characterizing Online Discussions in Vector Space (Cheng et al., EMNLP 2017)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Active learning doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to get much attention in NLP, probably because of fear that developing data based on the errors of one model will introduce a particular sampling bias. This paper is a nice example of a problem it can be applied to that doesn\u0026rsquo;t raise that issue: detecting all the errors in a system\u0026rsquo;s output.\nThe scenario is that you have a bunch of models for doing a task (e.g. POS tagging) and a new dataset with no labeled data, which you would like to label. Having a person label the data would take a long time and doesn\u0026rsquo;t take advantage of these systems. At the same time, we can\u0026rsquo;t just run the systems and use their output because they aren\u0026rsquo;t perfect, particularly out of domain. We could run the systems and check their output, which could be faster than annotating directly, but would still take a long time. If we don\u0026rsquo;t mind having some errors, we can check just some output, but how do we decide what to check?\nThis paper applies the generative model from MACE to build a generative model of system outputs. The model is:\n For each example, sample the true label with a uniform prior Then, for each classifier, sample from a Bernoulli distribution to decide if they are good or not A good classifier returns the true label, a not good classifier samples from a multinomial over the options  Since we don\u0026rsquo;t know the parameters of the model, or the true labels, use expectation maximisation to learn.\nThis work takes that model, trains it and uses it to identify the sample that is most uncertain. A person annotates it, the correct label replaces one of the system predictions, and EM is run again. This is repeated until either there appear to be no more errors, or annotators run out of time.\nHow well does it work? The main metric is precision: how many of the instances asked for annotation actually have errors. For POS tagging on WSJ text, the taggers initially get 2.5% of words wrong. To get that down to 1.1% the precision is 33%, and to get it to 0.65% precision is 17.6%. On an out of domain dataset, the error rate is 10% initially, and is down to 5% with a precision of 50%. Put differently, in a dataset of 25,000 tokens, with 2,500 errors, after checking 2,500 tokens, there are only 1,250 errors (another 2,500 checks brings it down to 730). It also works well for NER, and consistently does better than the alternative they compare to (consider the taggers a committee and find the examples with highest entropy, i.e. greatest disagreement).\nThis seems like a natural fit for prodigy and something that could be broadly useful.\nCitation  Paper\n@InProceedings{rehbein-ruppenhofer:2017:Long, author = {Rehbein, Ines and Ruppenhofer, Josef}, title = {Detecting annotation noise in automatically labelled data}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)}, month = {July}, year = {2017}, address = {Vancouver, Canada}, publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics}, pages = {1160--1170}, url = {http://aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1107} }  ","date":1507915939,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1507915939,"objectID":"9de8fcb58feacf69021fc9292b860e2c","permalink":"http://www.jkk.name/post/2017-10-13_errordetection/","publishdate":"2017-10-13T13:32:19-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/2017-10-13_errordetection/","section":"post","summary":"When labeling a dataset automatically there are going to be errors, but we can use a generative model and active learning to guide effort to checking the examples most likely to be incorrect.","tags":["paper","acl","annotation"],"title":"Detecting annotation noise in automatically labelled data (Rehbein and Ruppenhofer, ACL 2017)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) structures represent sentence meaning with labeled nodes (concepts) that are related to the words in the sentence, but not explicitly linked to them. This is a problem for most parsing algorithms, which need a way to efficiently decompose the structure in order to learn how to generate it. In dependency parsing there are no abstract nodes to generate, in constituency parsing there is a very small set of node types, and for CCG, TAG, etc the labels come from a constrained space. The solution for many AMR parsers is to have a process for generating the concepts as a first step towards parsing, and to automatically align the training data to guide this concept generation stage.\nThe first idea in this paper is about the set of AMR concepts. Some concepts are easy to link, as the concept clearly maps to a single word in the sentence. Around a quarter of concepts have a more complex relation, where a set of concepts link to a set of words, for example, named entities. The idea for these is to identify common subgraphs by abstracting some lexical items. For example, a teacher and a worker both get mapped to a person concept that is the ARG0 of the lexical item (teach, or work in this case). This can allow for the generation of entirely novel concepts (e.g. \u0026ldquo;concept\u0026rdquo;-er), giving a 0.6 boost to recall for CAMR simply by making these additional concepts available. Using a bidirectional LSTM with a character CNN to generate features on likely concepts, there is a gain of 1.0 F1 for the parser.\nThe second idea is to improve the alignments used to train concept generation by taking into consideration the graph structure. To use an aligner developed for machine translation the graph needs to be turned into a linear sequence, but that can lead to strange jumps. The idea here is to take that into consideration by modifying the calculation of the cost of distortion (i.e. jumping) to be reshaped based on the graph structure. For optimal alignment quality they consider aligning in either direction, directly changing the distance metric in the English-AMR direction, and just rescaling it to be less sensitive when appropriate for AMR-English. This is definitely higher precision than prior approaches, but lower recall. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to tell whether this helps, since the evaluation doesn\u0026rsquo;t separate it out from the first idea (results in section 5.3 are not on the same dataset as 5.1).\nGiven how separate this is from CAMR, it would be interesting to see if it helps other systems similarly. With concept identification at 83 F there is still plenty of scope for improvement, though there is no analysis of which types of concepts remain the most problematic.\nCitation  Paper\n@InProceedings{wang-xue:2017:EMNLP2017, author = {Wang, Chuan and Xue, Nianwen}, title = {Getting the Most out of AMR Parsing}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing}, month = {September}, year = {2017}, address = {Copenhagen, Denmark}, publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics}, pages = {1268--1279}, url = {https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D17-1130}, }  ","date":1507852354,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1507852354,"objectID":"348b1d8db9bccb6fe3c6a8c939e5881e","permalink":"http://www.jkk.name/post/2017-10-12_amralignment/","publishdate":"2017-10-12T19:52:34-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/2017-10-12_amralignment/","section":"post","summary":"Two ideas for improving AMR parsing: (1) take graph distance into consideration when generating alignments, (2) during parsing, for concept generation, generate individual concepts in some cases and frequently occurring subgraphs in other cases.","tags":["paper","emnlp","amr"],"title":"Getting the Most out of AMR Parsing (Wang and Xue, EMNLP 2017)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"This paper is a detailed analysis of a surprisingly effective simple idea: train a machine translation system with sentence pairs from multiple languages, adjusting the input to have an extra token at the end that says what the target language is. To deal with class imbalance, data is oversampled to have all language pairs be equally represented (though even without that, it works fairly well).\nThe biggest advantage of this approach is that a single model can handle translation between many pairs, rather than needing $O(n^2)$ models for $n$ languages. The performance is slightly lower on average, but the single model can manage with far fewer parameters. In one example, twelve models are combined into a single model with as many parameters as one of the twelve, and the results are lower by just 0.76 BLEU on average. Another advantage of the model is the ability to handle code-switched language, though they didn\u0026rsquo;t have evaluation datasets to get an quantitative measure of accuracy.\nHaving this model also opens up the possibility of translating between pairs of languages with no parallel training data (A -\u0026gt; B). As long as there is data (A -\u0026gt; C) and (D -\u0026gt; B), sentences from A can be fed in with B as the target language. For closely related languages this works very well, and in particular, better than going via another language such that there is data for the two language pairs. For example, going from Portuguese to Spanish with the multilingual model scores 24.75, whereas going via English scores 21.62 and a model with explicit training data gets 31.50. Going between less related languages is less successful, with direct Spanish to Japanese scoring 9.14, and going via English scoring 18.00. One thing I wish the paper had is more exploration of this result - what does it get right when scoring 9.14? For the time being at least, going via a third language still seems necessary, and presumably the best language to use is whichever one the performance is highest on.\nCitation  Paper\n ArXiv version which appears to be the same aside from one extra figure of the model architecture.\nAs an aside, it is interesting to see the timeline for this paper:\n November 2016, Submission to ArXiv and in the TACL submission batch March 2017, TACL revision batch October 2017, TACL published  @article{TACL1081, author = {Johnson, Melvin and Schuster, Mike and Le, Quoc and Krikun, Maxim and Wu, Yonghui and Chen, Zhifeng and Thorat, Nikhil and Viégas, Fernanda and Wattenberg, Martin and Corrado, Greg and Hughes, Macduff and Dean, Jeffrey}, title = {Google's Multilingual Neural Machine Translation System: Enabling Zero-Shot Translation}, journal = {Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics}, volume = {5}, year = {2017}, issn = {2307-387X}, url = {https://www.transacl.org/ojs/index.php/tacl/article/view/1081}, pages = {339--351} }  ","date":1507757344,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1507757344,"objectID":"61ce10e2ad520b0f41990806e78a79bb","permalink":"http://www.jkk.name/post/2017-10-11_multimt/","publishdate":"2017-10-11T17:29:04-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/2017-10-11_multimt/","section":"post","summary":"A translation model trained on sentence pairs from a mixture of languages can do very well across all of the languages, and even generalise somewhat to new pairs of the languages.

In reality, we often ask a series of simple questions that together form a complex one, for example \u0026ldquo;What flights are available from Detroit to Sydney? And how much is the price if I don\u0026rsquo;t want to leave before 8am?\u0026rdquo; This work explores these kinds of sequential questions with a new dataset and algorithm.\nThe dataset was formed by asking crowd workers to rephrase questions from the WikiTableQuestions dataset into sequences of shorter questions. This naturally constrains the types of questions (in particular, they reference a single table only), but covers a range of domains. With 6,066 question sequences, and on average 2.9 questions / sequence, it\u0026rsquo;s a large dataset by semantic parsing standards. However, there are no logical forms, only the row, column, or cell(s) that contain the answer.\nTo solve the problem, they treat it as choosing a sequence of actions, where each action generate a part of the execution instructions. The model follows the recent approach of considering the contents of the database as part of the calculation (e.g. by taking the dot product of the vector for a cell and the vector for the question).\nThe system has consistently better performance than other QA systems on the new dataset (though no results are shown for the WikiTableQuestions dataset). At only 12.8% of sequences completely correct, there is plenty of scope for improvement. Based on the description of the operators there are definitely additional abilities that would be useful, so this model has potential to improve. That said, it seems difficult to generalise the model to handle more complicated databases with multiple interconnected tables.\nCitation  Paper\n@InProceedings{iyyer-yih-chang:2017:Long, author = {Iyyer, Mohit and Yih, Wen-tau and Chang, Ming-Wei}, title = {Search-based Neural Structured Learning for Sequential Question Answering}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)}, month = {July}, year = {2017}, address = {Vancouver, Canada}, publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics}, pages = {1821--1831}, url = {http://aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1167} }  ","date":1507657416,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1507657416,"objectID":"74b8e57a4a46d8a3fbfcdee740009841","permalink":"http://www.jkk.name/post/2017-10-10_seqqa/","publishdate":"2017-10-10T13:43:36-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/2017-10-10_seqqa/","section":"post","summary":"A new dataset containing multi-turn questions about a table, and a model that generates a kind of logical form, but scores actions based on the content of the table.","tags":["paper","acl","semantic-parsing"],"title":"Search-based Neural Structured Learning for Sequential Question Answering (Iyyer et al., ACL 2017)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Semantic parsing datasets are small because they are expensive to produce (logical forms don\u0026rsquo;t occur naturally and writing them down takes time). The idea here is to do semi-supervised learning by implementing both a parser and a generator, which are trained together as a form of autoencoder where the intermediate representation is natural language.\nThe architecture has four LSTMs:\n Bidirectional LSTM over a logical form. One directional LSTM attending to the first LSTM\u0026rsquo;s hidden states, generating a sentence. Bidirectional LSTM over the sentence generated by the second LSTM. One directional LSTM attending to the third LSTM\u0026rsquo;s hidden states, generating a logical form.  Usually a component like the second LSTM would choose the max word at each position (or use beam search), but here they want this whole thing to be differentiable, so the distribution over words is used. At evaluation time only the second half (3+4) is used, with the test sentence as input.\nWith this structure, a loss function is defined that compares the input to (1) and the output of (4), which in both cases is a logical form. As a result, they don\u0026rsquo;t need (logical form, sentence) pairs to train, they can use automatically generated logical forms. Of course, with only logical forms it would do something random with the intermediate representation, so some supervised examples are also needed (in which case the two halves are trained independently).\nThe results are not state-of-the-art, but good on all three tasks (Geoquery, NLmaps, SAIL), and on two they show am improvement over training (3+4) with only supervised data. Varying the amount of training data gives a less clear picture. On Geoquery with 5-25% of the data, this approach clearly helps, particularly if the queries are real rather than generated (which is a realistic scenario), but then there is no improvement for 50% or 75%, and at 100% the improvement is small. On NLmaps there was no generator, and the differences at different data %s seem like noise. SAIL has the most clear benefit, though it\u0026rsquo;s a particularly small dataset, consisting of paths in just four maps.\nThis is a cool idea that seems effective in certain situations. The generator is key, and it\u0026rsquo;s possible that performance on GeoQuery would be higher with a more sophisticated one (e.g. a tree structured generator, rather than the ngram model used here). One idea mentioned in the conclusion is to try reversing the setup (3-4-1-2) and training with natural language examples that have no logical form.

Most work has considered very specific types of jokes (e.g. \u0026ldquo;that\u0026rsquo;s what she said\u0026rdquo;, or pairs of words that sound similar to form riddles). This work contributes (1) a new task, (2) an evaluation method, and (3) an example system.\nThe task is Mad Libs, where a story has some words removed and people choose new words to make the story funny. If you are familiar with the normal version, one key difference is that here people have access to the complete story when they are choosing their words. A set of 40 \u0026lsquo;stories\u0026rsquo; were written based on Simple Wikipedia articles, and workers on Mechanical Turk wrote words to fill them, with filtering based on judging by other workers.\nThe evaluation method involved recruiting a set of judges on Mechanical Turk and asking a series of questions to measure humour for a given response. As well as judging the overall story, they were asked to select which words contributed the most. By aggregating these selections as votes, each word was scored as funny or not.\nThe system is a linear classifier with a range of features, including scores from a language model. On its own, it performs very poorly, but using it as a filter to restrict the space of words a person can choose from actually leads to better performance than people on their own. Of course, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to analyse the source of improvement; The authors theorise that it is because it prevents people from selecting words that only they would see is funny. Another interpretation is that the constraint gives them a smaller space to think about and so they can find more interesting plays on words.\nFinally, as a non-expert in this area, this paper had some nice discussion of the tradeoffs between different ways of generating humour (incongruous vs. coherent content strategies).\nCitation  Paper\n@InProceedings{hossain-EtAl:2017:EMNLP2017, author = {Hossain, Nabil and Krumm, John and Vanderwende, Lucy and Horvitz, Eric and Kautz, Henry}, title = {Filling the Blanks (hint: plural noun) for Mad Libs Humor}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing}, month = {September}, year = {2017}, address = {Copenhagen, Denmark}, publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics}, pages = {649--658}, url = {https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D17-1068}, }  ","date":1507311103,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1507311103,"objectID":"8677120b0604dbfda4fea3d37859ab13","permalink":"http://www.jkk.name/post/2017-10-06-madlibs/","publishdate":"2017-10-06T13:31:43-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/2017-10-06-madlibs/","section":"post","summary":"A new task and associated evaluation method plus system for Mad Libs - filling in missing words in a story in a funny way.

Reduce communication on the GPU by halving the number of bits used to represent numbers.  Either of these gives a speed up of ~1.5x and together they give ~2x, across a range of different computer vision tasks+models.\nCore ideas in detail The first idea, reducing work by eliminating parts of the computation, has been considered before. In the past, however, the focus was on saving memory in models, and so the most common strategy was to move to a sparse matrix where weights close to zero are dropped. Here the focus is on speed and they show that while the sparse approach saves memory it can end up being slower because of hardware behaviour. Instead, they eliminate entire rows of the matrix, which means there is less computation, but it remains dense (and therefore fast). Rows are identified by measuring correlation between outputs and greedily eliminating rows that correlate highly with the rest of the output.\nThe natural question to ask is whether this hurts performance. First, they do two things to avoid problems, (1) a scale factor is used to make sure the outputs are of the same range that they would have been with the full matrix, and (2) they restart training to fine-tune the network once pruning is set up. With high enough pruning accuracy does fall, but speed ups can be gained before that is a problem (the exact point depends on the task).\nThe second idea relates to numerical representation, and is motivated by measurements of where the bottlenecks are in communication. Many AI researchers have tried switching to 16 bit representations to save space and time, but here they develop a different floating point encoding that gives more bits to the exponent, and fewer to the mantissa.\nThoughts  It would be interesting to see the interaction of this work with the investigation of networks without non-linear functions that can still learn non-linear behaviour because of numerical approximations. In the context of language, the weight reduction approach would be interesting to analyse. Specifically, what do we lose in our word vectors depending on the task? I\u0026rsquo;ve always had some interest in making things faster. It would be interesting to know where the remaining bottlenecks are (after applying these changes).

Let\u0026rsquo;s try to come up with a model to tell us how much to order. Set it up like this:\n There are $N$ people. There are $P$ pizzas. The fraction of people who are vegetarian is $V$.

In this work, we study the task of identifying products being bought and sold in online cybercrime forums, which exhibits particularly challenging cross-domain effects.  We formulate a task that represents a hybrid of slot-filling information extraction and named entity recognition and annotate data from four different forums.  Each of these forums constitutes its own 'fine-grained domain' in that the forums cover different market sectors with different properties, even though all forums are in the broad domain of cybercrime. We characterize these domain differences in the context of a learning-based system: supervised models see decreased accuracy when applied to new forums, and standard techniques for semi-supervised learning and domain adaptation have limited effectiveness on this data, which suggests the need to improve these techniques.

Development of algorithms and statistical models over the past three decades has led to systems that are accurate enough to be deployed in industry, playing a key role in products such as Google Search and Apple Siri. However, syntactic parsers today are usually constrained to tree representations of language, and performance is interpreted through a single metric that conveys no linguistic information regarding remaining errors.\n\nIn this dissertation, we present new algorithms for error analysis and parsing. The heart of our approach to error analysis is the use of structural transformations to identify more meaningful classes of errors, and to enable comparisons across formalisms. For parsing, we combine a novel dynamic program with careful choices in syntactic representation to create an efficient parser that produces graph structured output. Together, these developments allowed us to evaluate the outstanding challenges in parsing and to address a key weakness in current work.\n\nFirst, we present a search algorithm that, given two structures, finds a sequence of modifications leading from one structure to the other. We applied this algorithm to syntactic error analysis, where one structure is the output of a parser, the other is the correct parse, and each modification corresponds to fixing one error. We constructed a tool based on the algorithm and analyzed variations in behavior between parsers, types of text, and languages. Our observations shine light on several assumptions about syntactic errors, showing some to be true and others to be false. For example, prepositional phrase attachment errors are indeed a major issue, while coordination scope errors do not hurt performance as much as expected.\n\nNext, we describe an algorithm that builds a parse in one syntactic representation to match a parse in another representation. Specifically, we build phrase structure parses from Combinatory Categorial Grammar derivations. Our approach follows the philosophy of CCG, defining specific phrase structures for each lexical category and generic rules for combinatory steps. The new parse is built by following the CCG derivation bottom-up, gradually building the corresponding phrase structure parse. This produced significantly more accurate parses than past work, and enabled us to compare performance of several parsers across formalisms.\n\nFinally, we address a weakness we observed in phrase structure parsers: the exclusion of syntactic trace structures for computational convenience. We present an efficient dynamic programming algorithm that constructs the graph structure that has the highest score under an edge-factored scoring function. We define a parse representation compatible with the algorithm, and show how certain linguistic distinctions dramatically impact coverage. We also show various ways to modify the algorithm to improve performance by exploiting properties of observed linguistic structure. This approach to syntactic parsing is the first to cover virtually all structure encoded in the Penn Treebank.","tags":null,"title":"Algorithms for Identifying Syntactic Errors and Parsing with Graph Structured Output","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonathan K.

By shifting work from the parser to the supertagger we dramatically improve speed.\\n\\nThis work demonstrates several major novel ideas that improve parsing efficiency. The core idea is that the tags chosen by the parser are gold standard data for its supertagger. This leads to the second surprising conceptual development, that decreasing tagging accuracy can improve parsing performance. To demonstrate these ideas required extensive development of the C\u0026C supertagger, including imple- mentation of more efficient estimation algorithms and parallelisation of the training process. This was particularly challenging as the C\u0026C supertagger is a state-of-the-art high performance system designed with a focus on speed rather than flexibility.\\n\\nI was able to significantly improve performance on the standard evaluation corpus by using the parser to generate extremely large new resources for supertagger training. I have also shown that these methods provide significant benefits on another domain, Wikipedia text, without the cost of generating human annotated data sets. These parsing performance gains occur while supertagging accuracy decreases.\\n\\nDespite extensive use of supertaggers to improve parsing efficiency there has been no comprehensive study of the interaction between a supertagger and a parser. I present the first systematic exploration of the relationship, show the potential benefits of understanding it, and demonstrate a novel algorithm for optimising the parameters that define it.\\n\\nI have constructed models that process newspaper text 86% faster than previously, and Wikipedia text 30% faster, without any loss in accuracy and without the aid of extra gold standard resources in either domain. This work will lead directly to improvements in a range of Natural Language Processing tasks by enabling the use of far more parsed data.","tags":null,"title":"Adaptive Supertagging for Faster Parsing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephen Clark","Ann Copestake","James R.

Companies are already using nlp tools to create web-scale question answering and 'semantic search' engines. Massive amounts of parsed web data will also allow the automatic creation of semantic knowledge resources on an unprecedented scale. The web is a challenging arena for syntactic parsing, because of its scale and variety of styles, genres, and domains.\\n\\nThe goals of our workshop were to scale and adapt an existing wide-coverage parser to Wikipedia text; improve the efficiency of the parser through various methods of chart pruning; use self-training to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the parser; use the parsed wiki data for an innovative form of bootstrapping to make the parser both more efficient and more accurate; and finally use the parsed web data for improved disambiguation of coordination structures, using a variety of syntactic and semantic knowledge sources.\\n\\nThe focus of the research was the C\u0026C parser (Clark and Curran, 2007c), a state-of-the-art statistical parser based on Combinatory Categorial Grammar (ccg). The parser has been evaluated on a number of standard test sets achieving state-of-the-art accuracies. It has also recently been adapted successfully to the biomedical domain (Rimell and Clark, 2009). The parser is surprisingly efficient, given its detailed output, processing tens of sentences per second. For web-scale text processing, we aimed to make the parser an order of magnitude faster still. The C\u0026C parser is one of only very few parsers currently available which has the potential to produce detailed, accurate analyses at the scale we were considering.","tags":null,"title":"Large-Scale Syntactic Processing: Parsing the Web","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonathan K.
