&lt;p&gt;Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) structures represent sentence meaning with labeled nodes (concepts) that are related to the words in the sentence, but not explicitly linked to them.
This is a problem for most parsing algorithms, which need a way to efficiently decompose the structure in order to learn how to generate it.
In dependency parsing there are no abstract nodes to generate, in constituency parsing there is a very small set of node types, and for CCG, TAG, etc the labels come from a constrained space.
The solution for many AMR parsers is to have a process for generating the concepts as a first step towards parsing, and to automatically align the training data to guide this concept generation stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first idea in this paper is about the set of AMR concepts.
Some concepts are easy to link, as the concept clearly maps to a single word in the sentence.
Around a quarter of concepts have a more complex relation, where a set of concepts link to a set of words, for example, named entities.
The idea for these is to identify common subgraphs by abstracting some lexical items.
For example, a teacher and a worker both get mapped to a person concept that is the ARG0 of the lexical item (teach, or work in this case).
This can allow for the generation of entirely novel concepts (e.g. &amp;ldquo;concept&amp;rdquo;-er), giving a 0.6 boost to recall for CAMR simply by making these additional concepts available.
Using a bidirectional LSTM with a character CNN to generate features on likely concepts, there is a gain of 1.0 F1 for the parser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second idea is to improve the alignments used to train concept generation by taking into consideration the graph structure.
To use an aligner developed for machine translation the graph needs to be turned into a linear sequence, but that can lead to strange jumps.
The idea here is to take that into consideration by modifying the calculation of the cost of distortion (i.e. jumping) to be reshaped based on the graph structure.
For optimal alignment quality they consider aligning in either direction, directly changing the distance metric in the English-AMR direction, and just rescaling it to be less sensitive when appropriate for AMR-English.
This is definitely higher precision than prior approaches, but lower recall.
It&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell whether this helps, since the evaluation doesn&amp;rsquo;t separate it out from the first idea (results in section 5.3 are not on the same dataset as 5.1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given how separate this is from CAMR, it would be interesting to see if it helps other systems similarly.
With concept identification at 83 F there is still plenty of scope for improvement, though there is no analysis of which types of concepts remain the most problematic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title> Semantic Parsing with Semi-Supervised Sequential Autoencoders (Kocisky et al., EMNLP 2016)</title>
      <link>http://www.jkk.name/post/2017-10-09_parsing-autoencoder/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Semantic parsing datasets are small because they are expensive to produce (logical forms don&amp;rsquo;t occur naturally and writing them down takes time).
The idea here is to do semi-supervised learning by implementing both a parser and a generator, which are trained together as a form of autoencoder where the intermediate representation is natural language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The architecture has four LSTMs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bidirectional LSTM over a logical form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One directional LSTM attending to the first LSTM&amp;rsquo;s hidden states, generating a sentence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bidirectional LSTM over the sentence generated by the second LSTM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One directional LSTM attending to the third LSTM&amp;rsquo;s hidden states, generating a logical form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually a component like the second LSTM would choose the max word at each position (or use beam search), but here they want this whole thing to be differentiable, so the distribution over words is used.
At evaluation time only the second half (3+4) is used, with the test sentence as input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this structure, a loss function is defined that compares the input to (1) and the output of (4), which in both cases is a logical form.
As a result, they don&amp;rsquo;t need (logical form, sentence) pairs to train, they can use automatically generated logical forms.
Of course, with only logical forms it would do something random with the intermediate representation, so some supervised examples are also needed (in which case the two halves are trained independently).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results are not state-of-the-art, but good on all three tasks (Geoquery, NLmaps, SAIL), and on two they show am improvement over training (3+4) with only supervised data.
Varying the amount of training data gives a less clear picture.
On Geoquery with 5-25% of the data, this approach clearly helps, particularly if the queries are real rather than generated (which is a realistic scenario), but then there is no improvement for 50% or 75%, and at 100% the improvement is small.
On NLmaps there was no generator, and the differences at different data %s seem like noise.
SAIL has the most clear benefit, though it&amp;rsquo;s a particularly small dataset, consisting of paths in just four maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a cool idea that seems effective in certain situations.
The generator is key, and it&amp;rsquo;s possible that performance on GeoQuery would be higher with a more sophisticated one (e.g. a tree structured generator, rather than the ngram model used here).
One idea mentioned in the conclusion is to try reversing the setup (3-4-1-2) and training with natural language examples that have no logical form.
How to tradeoff the different data scenarios seems like an interesting challenge!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Filling the Blanks (hint: plural noun) for Mad Libs Humor (Hossain et al., EMNLP 2017)</title>
      <link>http://www.jkk.name/post/2017-10-06-madlibs/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Humor is an incredibly difficult problem, as this paper makes clear in its background section.
Most work has considered very specific types of jokes (e.g. &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s what she said&amp;rdquo;, or pairs of words that sound similar to form riddles).
This work contributes (1) a new task, (2) an evaluation method, and (3) an example system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task is Mad Libs, where a story has some words removed and people choose new words to make the story funny.
If you are familiar with the normal version, one key difference is that here people have access to the complete story when they are choosing their words.
A set of 40 &amp;lsquo;stories&amp;rsquo; were written based on Simple Wikipedia articles, and workers on Mechanical Turk wrote words to fill them, with filtering based on judging by other workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evaluation method involved recruiting a set of judges on Mechanical Turk and asking a series of questions to measure humour for a given response.
As well as judging the overall story, they were asked to select which words contributed the most.
By aggregating these selections as votes, each word was scored as funny or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system is a linear classifier with a range of features, including scores from a language model.
On its own, it performs very poorly, but using it as a filter to restrict the space of words a person can choose from actually leads to better performance than people on their own.
Of course, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to analyse the source of improvement;
The authors theorise that it is because it prevents people from selecting words that only they would see is funny.
Another interpretation is that the constraint gives them a smaller space to think about and so they can find more interesting plays on words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as a non-expert in this area, this paper had some nice discussion of the tradeoffs between different ways of generating humour (incongruous vs. coherent content strategies).&lt;/p&gt;
