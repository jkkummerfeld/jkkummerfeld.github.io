      <description>Notes We use Dropbox Paper to manage project notes, with one document per project. The structure is:&#xA;Title, this will be &amp;ldquo;Student - Topic&amp;rdquo;. Abstract, this is intended to be what you would write if you were to write up the project as a paper now. It should have 1-2 sentences each for: (a) motivation, (b) idea, (c) results. The results will have placeholders, e.g. you could write &amp;ldquo;We found that that approach scored X on dataset Y, outperforming prior work on the task.</description>

Below are suggestions for how to be an effective mentee in my lab based on my observations of students.&#xA;Be responsive:&#xA;Read your email at least once each weekday. Either (a) send a complete response within two working days or (b) send an email acknowledging the message and giving an estimate of when you will respond.</description>
