We demonstrate faster methods for training a supertagger using hundreds of millions of automatically annotated words, constructing statistical models that further constrain the number of derivations the parser must consider. By introducing new features and using an automatically annotated corpus we are able to double parsing speed on Wikipedia and the Wall Street Journal, and gain accuracy slightly when parsing Section 00 of the Wall Street Journal.},
