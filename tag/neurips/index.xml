      <description>&lt;p&gt;Games have been a focus of AI research for decades, from Samuel&amp;rsquo;s checkers program in the 1950s, to Deep Blue playing Chess in the 1990s, and AlphaGo playing Go in the 2010s.
All of those are two-player sequential games.
In this paper (to appear at NeurIPS), we looked at Diplomacy, a seven player game with simultaneous turns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper makes three main contributions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A neural model that plays the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software to play the game (determining the outcomes of player actions is a non-trivial problem).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experiments with supervised learning and reinforcement learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our paper only considers the version of the game where players can not talk to each other (No Press).
Engaging in conversation in the game is a fascinating challenge that will involve a lot more work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How well does the bot play the game?
It convincingly beats prior systems designed for the game.
Playing against it, I saw an impressive improvement over the course of the project.
Early on I won trivially with mostly conservative moves.
Later I had to carefully consider my moves, and was unable to win as certain powers (e.g. Austria).
Eventually I was unable to beat the bot without playing several times, using observations from one game to inform my strategy in subsequent games.
I am not an expert player, but I doubt a human playing one power in the game with no prior knowledge can win against the bot.
However, I think a single bot playing against six skilled humans would almost definitely lose (we did not test this setting).&lt;/p&gt;
