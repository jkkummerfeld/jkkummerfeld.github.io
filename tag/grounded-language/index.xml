      <title>ChartDialogs: Plotting from Natural Language Instructions (Shao and Nakashole, ACL 2020)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Natural language interfaces to computer systems are an exciting area with new workshops (
&lt;a href=&#34;https://aclanthology.org/volumes/2020.nli-1/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;WNLI&lt;/a&gt; at ACL and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://intex-sempar.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;IntEx-SemPar&lt;/a&gt; at EMNLP), a range of datasets (including my own work on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jkk.name/publication/acl18sql/&#34;&gt;text-to-SQL&lt;/a&gt;), and many papers.
Most work focuses on either (1) commands for simple APIs, (2) generating a database query, or (3) generating general purpose code.
This paper considers an interesting application: interaction with data visualisation tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the full flexibility of these tools is a tall order, so this work focuses on commands to modify style parameters of a figure.
For that setting, the problem can be framed as task-oriented dialogue in which each style parameter (e.g. x-axis font size) is a slot that needs to be defined.
Using this framing of the problem, the paper presents a new dataset of 3,200 conversations in which a person modifies the style of a plot.
These were collected on Mechanical Turk by having one worker describe a target plot and another worker manipulating values for parameters to match it.
There are 12 plot types with 3-13 properties, with the target plot randomly generated.
Baseline approaches do fairly well, but far short of a human (either another worker or one of the authors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a large resource with high agreement between annotators and the paper presents detailed analysis and helpful examples.
One experiment I&amp;rsquo;d be curious to see is results with a fixed number of training examples per plot type (or per slot type).
Histograms and scatter plots appear particularly difficult in the breakdown of results by plot type, but they are also the types with the fewest examples (a tenth as many as the type with the most).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find this general topic exciting because it brings together several areas of NLP and it seems feasible to create a useful system in the near future.
Hopefully there will be progress on models for this dataset and development of additional resources.
In particular, there was a decision here to limit generation to slot-values, which is powerful, but does not capture the full flexibility of matplotlib (at least not without further work on representing more features this way).
Arbitrary code generation would be a fantastic extension, though creating the data would require some creativity as the approach used here wouldn&amp;rsquo;t directly work.&lt;/p&gt;

    abstract = &amp;quot;This paper presents the problem of conversational plotting agents that carry out plotting actions from natural language instructions. To facilitate the development of such agents, we introduce ChartDialogs, a new multi-turn dialog dataset, covering a popular plotting library, matplotlib. The dataset contains over 15,000 dialog turns from 3,200 dialogs covering the majority of matplotlib plot types. Extensive experiments show the best-performing method achieving 61{\%} plotting accuracy, demonstrating that the dataset presents a non-trivial challenge for future research on this task.&amp;quot;,

      <title>Natural Language Does Not Emerge &#39;Naturally&#39; in Multi-Agent Dialog (Kottur et al., 2017)</title>
      <link>https://www.jkk.name/post/2017-11-13_languagegame/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In reference games, two players communicate in a shared world with the goal of one learning what the other is referring to.
Their small scale and clear success criteria make them a convenient testbed for dialogue agents, going back decades, with recent work focusing on neural approaches.
This paper considers a simple game and constrains models in various ways to improve performance and see how their communication varies, a line of work also appearing in recent papers by Jacob Andreas (
&lt;a href=&#34;https://aclanthology.org/P17-1022.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ACL 2017&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://aclanthology.org/D17-1311.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;EMNLP 2017&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game in this case is to find out two properties of an object, where there are three possible properties, each with four possible values.
Given enough flexibility, models will explicitly encode every possible structure of the world as a separate symbol, which does not generalise well.
Limiting the vocabulary to one symbol per property and one per value helps, but in this particular game there are only 3 possible questions, and over two turns of dialogue the 12 value words are sufficient to encode the space.
Limiting even further, to 4 words for values and providing each turn in isolation to the answerer does lead to some compositionality, but clearly not full compositionality as they still make errors on unseen combinations of the inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a short paper, so they can only do so much, but some experiments I am curious about are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decrease the questioner vocabulary to 2. This avoids the problem that the questioner can express the task in one step by saying what is not needed. It&amp;rsquo;s still doable, by defining an order for questions, e.g. ask about attribute A vs. B first, then in the second step ask about either C or the other option from the first step. This is a little weird as symbols need to mean different things at different time steps, but would be interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase the number of attributes to 4. This also avoids the task expression problem, by forcing there to be compositionality on the questioner side (watching the video of the talk, someone asked this in the question time, and they didn&amp;rsquo;t know).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
