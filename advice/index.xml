      <description>Your poster should be optimised for the following conference experience:&#xA;A person walks past your poster and sees enough from a distance to get the key idea.

Optimising for this has a few implications:&#xA;Have a short (5-20 word) explanation in a large font that communicates the key idea.</description>

I found the browser UI for Outlook frustrating, so I went in search of another email client.&#xA;I looked at and tried a wide range of clients. Below are my notes about what I liked / did not like about each one. Of course, these reflect my preferences.</description>
