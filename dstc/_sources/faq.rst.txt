2. **What should we submit**?

    You are required to submit the responses to the test dataset that will be released on the 10th of September. The format of the responses can be found under `submissions` section.

3. **Do we need to work on both datasets**?

    Not necessary. You can select one dataset and work on all or a subset of the subtasks. But, submitting results for both datasets and all subtasks will increase your chance of winning the competition.

4. **How are we evaluated**?

    For each test instance, we expect you to return a set of 100 choices (candidate ids) from the set candidates and a probability distribution over those 100 choices. For more details please check the `evaluations` section.

4. **What do you mean by end-to-end models**?

    We don't need the whole system to be end-to-end trainable. You can have separate components, which are not trained with back-propagation. However, we expect the functionality of each of the components in your system to be learned from the given dataset. We discourage the use of hand-coded features for any component in your system, as one of the focus points of the challenge is automation.

5. **Can we use pre-trained word embeddings**?

    You can use any pre-trained embeddings that was publicly available before the 1st of June.
