Noetic End-to-End Response Selection Challenge
==============================================

**Update** - A tensorflow based baseline for subtask 1 of the track is available `here <https://github.com/IBM/dstc7-noesis/tree/models/noesis-tf>`_.

This challenge is part of dialog state tracking challenge (DSTC 7) series. It provides a partial conversation, and requires participants to select the correct next utterances from a set of candidates.
Unlike previous similar challenges, this task tries to push towards real world problems by introducing:

- A large number of candidates
- Cases where no candidate is correct
- External data

This challenge is offered with two goal oriented dialog datasets, used in 5 subtasks.
A participant may participate in one, several, or all the subtasks.
A full description of the track is available `here <http://workshop.colips.org/dstc7/proposals/Track%201%20Merged%20Challenge%20Extended%20Desscription_v2.pdf>`_.
