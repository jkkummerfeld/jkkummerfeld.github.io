&lt;p&gt;Humor is an incredibly difficult problem, as this paper makes clear in its background section.
Most work has considered very specific types of jokes (e.g. &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s what she said&amp;rdquo;, or pairs of words that sound similar to form riddles).
This work contributes (1) a new task, (2) an evaluation method, and (3) an example system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task is Mad Libs, where a story has some words removed and people choose new words to make the story funny.
If you are familiar with the normal version, one key difference is that here people have access to the complete story when they are choosing their words.
A set of 40 &amp;lsquo;stories&amp;rsquo; were written based on Simple Wikipedia articles, and workers on Mechanical Turk wrote words to fill them, with filtering based on judging by other workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evaluation method involved recruiting a set of judges on Mechanical Turk and asking a series of questions to measure humour for a given response.
As well as judging the overall story, they were asked to select which words contributed the most.
By aggregating these selections as votes, each word was scored as funny or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system is a linear classifier with a range of features, including scores from a language model.
On its own, it performs very poorly, but using it as a filter to restrict the space of words a person can choose from actually leads to better performance than people on their own.
Of course, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to analyse the source of improvement;
The authors theorise that it is because it prevents people from selecting words that only they would see is funny.
Another interpretation is that the constraint gives them a smaller space to think about and so they can find more interesting plays on words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as a non-expert in this area, this paper had some nice discussion of the tradeoffs between different ways of generating humour (incongruous vs. coherent content strategies).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ordering Pizza for an Event with Vegetarians</title>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-much-vegetarian-pizza-should-i-order&#34;&gt;How much vegetarian pizza should I order?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question frequently comes up in the world of free food at university events. In my experience (as someone who does not eat meat pizzas), often not enough is ordered. Let&amp;rsquo;s try to come up with a model to tell us how much to order. Set it up like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are $N$ people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are $P$ pizzas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fraction of people who are vegetarian is $V$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assume everyone eats the same amount of pizza, and all the pizza is eaten (ie. each person eats $\frac{P}{N}$).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assume people randomly sample from the available pizzas, subject to the constraint that some eat only vegetarian pizzas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let the fraction of vegetarian pizzas we get be $k$, and we can write down the number of vegetarian pizzas in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many we order: $P * k$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many are eaten: (pizzas eaten by vegetarians) + (vegetarian pizzas eaten by others) = $\frac{P}{N} * (N * V) + \frac{P}{N} * (N * (1 - V)) * k$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since all the pizza we order is eaten, these are equal.
$N$ and $P$ are both positive numbers, so we can safely cancel the $N$s and divide through by $P$, giving:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$V + (1 - V) * k = k$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To satisfy this equation, $k = 1$. Therefore all the pizza should be vegetarian :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, these assumptions aren&amp;rsquo;t quite right (for example, not everyone samples randomly from the available pizza), so here are some more useful suggestions too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do order more than the proportion of vegetarians.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place the vegetarian pizza at the end of the line of pizzas, or in a separate location with clear signage discouraging non-vegetarians from eating it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Order a diverse set of popular meat pizzas (people tend to want variety, so this encourages them to try more meat pizzas).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
